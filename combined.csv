"Oh, we had such luck in Orlando, we love being in Orlando. Thank you. Thank you, Orlando. What a turnout! What a turnout! You know this is a very big arena for a Tuesday night. I said, you know, if we have about three or four empty seats, the fake news will say, Headlines: ""He didn't fill up the arena"", so I said, maybe we shouldn't take a chance."
"Maybe we shouldn't go to Orlando as you go someplace else, then I said, ""No, I think, we'll go to Orlando."" And -- and not only did we fill it up, but we had 120,000 requests. That means you folks have come out very, very good. Congratulations. I want to thank our great Vice President Mike Pence and his wonderful wife, Karen Pence, and our magnificent First Lady Melania, thank you."
"I am thrilled to be back in my second home. That's what it is. It's my second home. In many cases, I think I could say it's my first home, if you want to know the truth. It's the great state of Florida, very historic, because exactly four years ago this week, I announced my campaign for president of the United States and it turned out to be more than just a political campaign."
"It turned out to be a great political movement because of you. A great movement. A movement made up of hard working patriots who love their country, love their flag, love their children, and who believe that a nation must care for its own citizens first. Together, we stared down a corrupt and broken political establishment and we restored government of, by, and for the people."
"Our country is now thriving, prospering and booming. And frankly, it's soaring to incredible new heights. Our economy is the envy of the world, perhaps the greatest economy we've had in the history of our country. And as long as you keep this team in place, we have a tremendous way to go. Our future has never ever looked brighter or sharper."
"The fact is, the American Dream is back, it's bigger and better, and stronger than ever, before. 2016 was not merely another four-year election. This was a defining moment in American history. Ask them right there. By the way, that is a lot of fake news back there, that's a lot. You know what I say, the amount of press we have tonight reminds me of the Academy Awards before it went political and their ratings went down the tubes."
"This was our chance to reclaim our government from a permanent political class that enriched itself at your expense. As I said, what a wonderful beautiful day at my inauguration, we did not merely transfer power from one party to another, but we transferred power back to you, the proud citizens of the United States of America."
"We stared down the unholy alliance of lobbyists and donors and special interests, who made a living, bleeding our country dry. That's what we've done. We broke down the doors of Washington backrooms, where deals were cut to close our companies, give away your jobs, shut down our factories, and surrender your sovereignty and your very way of life, and we've ended it. We took on a political machine that tried to take away your voice and your vote."
"They tried to take away your dignity and your destiny, but we will never let them do that, will we? Many times I said, ""We would drain the swamp."", and that's exactly what we're doing right now, we're draining the swamp. And that's why the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently. For the last two and a half years, we have been under siege, and with the Mueller report we won, and now they want a do over, they want a do over."
"Let's do it again, didn't work out too well, let's do it again. They want a do over. No president should ever have to go through this again. It is so bad for our great country. Our hopes, the great hopes. Our patriotic movement has been under assault from the very first day. We accomplish more than any other president has in the first two and a half years of a presidency and under circumstances that no president has had to deal with before, because we did in the middle of the great and illegal witch hunt, things that nobody have been able to accomplish, not even close."
"Nobody's done what we have done in two and a half years. We went through the greatest witch hunt in political history. The only collusion was committed by the Democrats, the fake news media and their operatives and the people who funded the phony dossier, crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. It was all an illegal attempt to overturn the results of the election spy on our campaign, which is what they did and subvert our democracy."
"Remember, the insurance policy, just in case Hillary Clinton lost. Remember the insurance policy? They appointed 18 very angry Democrats to try to take down our incredible movement. After two years, 1.4 million pages of documents, 500 search warrants, 500 witnesses, 2,800 subpoenas, and 40 FBI agents working round the clock."
"What did they come up with? No collusion. And the facts that led our great attorney general to determine no obstruction. No collusion, no obstruction. And they spent $40 million on this witch hunt, $40 million. That's right, they spent $40 million, probably a hell of a lot more than that. And think about it, nobody's been tougher on Russia than Donald Trump."
"Nobody. We call it The Russian hoax. Remember, President Obama's famous line caught on the open mic, secretly telling the Russian president to quote, ""Inform Vladimir that after my election I'll have more flexibility."" Okay. Remember that? Remember that? Lot of people remember that, I remembered it. I saw it happen, I didn't like it. They don't bring it up. The fake news will never bring it up. And in September, just before the election, the FBI told President Obama about possible Russian interference and he did nothing because he thought that Hillary Clinton, Crooked Hillary was going to win, that's why he did nothing."
"He did nothing. I built up the military, imposed sanctions on Russia, and provided alternative energy sources for all over Europe that competed very, very strongly with Russia. We are, by the way, the No.1 producer of energy in the world because of what we've done right now, The Democrats don't care about Russia, they only care about their own political power."
"They went after my family, my business, my finances, my employees, almost everyone that I've ever known or worked with, but they are really going after you. That's what it's all about, not about us, it's about you. They tried to erase your vote, erase your legacy of the greatest campaign and the greatest election, probably in the history of our country, and they wanted to deny you the future that you demanded and the future that America deserves, and that now America is getting."
"Our Radical Democrat opponents are driven by hatred, prejudice, and rage. They want to destroy you and they want to destroy our country, as we know it. Not acceptable, it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. To understand Democrats ruthless tactics, look no further than the United States Supreme Court and our court system nationwide."
"I will soon have appointed my 145th judge. President Obama was very nice to us. He didn't fill the positions. I get there the first day. ""How many judges do I have to appoint?"", they said, ""Sir, 139."", now it's 145 and we've just finished number 107, already approved sitting on the bench, how about that?"
"And by the time we're finished with the rest, we will have a record percentages. Our percentage will be a record except for one person. One person has a higher percentage than your favorite President Donald Trump. You know who that president is? He's got a higher percentage than me and it's devastating. His name is George Washington."
"George is at 100% and there's no way I'm going to get there no matter what I tell you. Got 100%. Well, he was first, so he just appointed them all and that was it. That's going to be a hard record to beat. They want to take away your judges. They want to pack the court with far left ideologues and they want to radicalise our judiciary."
"You know that, we already have a lot of that. Look at what they did to a great gentleman, Justice Kavanagh, highly respected. They didn't just try to win. They tried to destroy him with false and malicious accusations. And thank you, Marco, and thank you Lindsey wherever you may be. Thank you, great job, thank you."
"Stand up. Yeah, Lindsey Graham was doing okay in South Carolina, aint that great? Now he's through the roof great. Thank you. Great job, thank you. Great people, great people, all of them. They tried to ruin the family of now, Justice Kavanagh. They tried to ruin his career, they tried to ruin his life. They even wanted to impeach him on fraudulent charges."
"Those charges were a fraud. He did nothing wrong. All in pursuit of political domination and control. Just imagine what this angry left-wing mob would do if they were in charge of this country. Imagine if we had a Democrat president and a Democrat congress in 2020. They would shut down your free speech, use the power of the law to punish their opponents, which they're trying to do now anyway, they'll always be trying to shield themselves."
"They would strip Americans of their constitutional rights while flooding the country with illegal immigrants in the hopes it will expand their political base, and they'll get votes someplace down the future. That's what it's about. And we are building the wall. We're going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year."
"It's moving rapidly, moving very rapidly. And you know we couldn't get the wall approved by the Democrats, even though they voted for it four years ago and six years ago and didn't get built, but they voted for it, all of a sudden, Trump is president, we don't want a wall. Can you imagine, can you imagine those caravans without having the barriers and walls that we've already put up and that are up. This country would be a mess like you wouldn't believe."
"So the wall is moving along, it's moving along rapidly. It's beautiful, I changed the design, it's stronger, bigger, better, and cheaper. Cheaper, a lot cheaper. You know sometimes when they don't give you the money, you have to make it cheaper, not going to happen, but it's going well. Instead of bringing us together as one America, Democrats want to splinter us into factions and tribes, they want us divided, not going to happen to the Republicans anymore, it's not going to happen."
"This election is not merely a verdict on the amazing progress we've made. It's a verdict on the un-American conduct of those who tried to undermine our great democracy, and undermine you. And by the way, on July 4th, in Washington, D.C., come on down, we're going have a big day. Bring your flags, bring those flags."
"Bring those American flags, July 4th, we're going to have hundreds of thousands of people, we're going to celebrate America. Sounds good, right? July 4th, celebrate America. This election is a verdict on whether we want to live in a country where the people who lose an election refuse to concede and spend the next two years trying to shred our Constitution and rip your country apart."
"You remember during one of the debates, when Crooked Hillary said, ""If I win, are you going to support me?"", but I must be honest, I didn't give her a great answer. That was a very -- I might have been my hardest question during the debates. Isn't it amazing that it worked the other way around, right? Is isn't it amazing?"
"If you want to know how the system is rigged, just compare how they came after us for three years with everything they had, versus the free pass they gave to Hillary and her aides after they set up an illegal server, destroyed evidence deleted and acid washed 33,000 e-mails, exposed classified information, and turned the State Department into a pay-for-play cash machine."
"33,000 emails deleted, think of it. I keep mentioning, you know, there was a lot of corruption on the other side, but you know the simplest thing, they get a subpoena from the United States Congress and they decide that they're not going to give it so Lindsey Graham, they did delete and they acid wash, which is very expensive."
"Nobody does it, they acid wash those emails, never to be seen again, but we may find them somewhere deep in the State Department. But can you imagine, if I got a subpoena, think of this, If I got a subpoena for e-mails, if I deleted one e-mail, like a love note to Melania, it's the electric chair for Trump, 33,000 e-mails."
"But let's see what happens, we now have a great attorney general, let's see what happens. So if you either shut down this rigged system once and for all, then show up November 3rd, that's your day, big day, and vote, vote, vote, we're going to have a big, big day. Thank you. And remember the only thing these corrupt politicians will understand is an earthquake at the ballot box, that's what they will understand, and they're going to see it. We did it once and now we will do it again, and this time we're going to finish the job, and this time should be a lot easier because we have done so much with our military, with our vets, with the Second Amendment, with our regulations, with the biggest tax cut in history, with getting rid of so many different problems, so many different things, including, by the way, the individual mandate in Obamacare, one of the worst things anybody's ever had to live through."
"We got rid of the individual mandate. Right? How many people are happy? They no longer have to pay for the privilege of not paying for bad health insurance. How many people are happy? Bad health care. So every time you don't have to make out a check in order not to have health care. Think of that, think of that."
"This is the only country you pay for the very distinct privilege of not having to pay but you have to pay a lot. Now you don't have to pay anymore. You don't want it, you don't have to pay. The individual mandate, Mike. We got rid of it. That was a big deal. The people tried to stop our movement are the same Washington insiders, who spent their careers rigging the system, so your losses will be their gains, you know that."
"These are the same career politicians who presided over decades of flat wages, the loss of our manufacturing jobs. Sixty thousand, could you believe that? Sixty thousand, who would believe that number? And you know how I know it's true, because if it wasn't I've been using it a lot. The fake news would have headlines: Trump used a phony number., they'll have headline."
"It would be the biggest story: Trump used -- well, they never corrected it, so I assumed, fellas, 60,000 shuttered factories. We closed up 60,000 factories, it didn't seem right. It didn't seem like it would be possible. And avalanche of job killing regulations, a growing wealth gap and one ruinous trade deal after another."
"By the way, those trade deals are getting very good folks, you will see. We just completed the deal with South Korea. Great deal. We're working with Mexico and Canada. We have to get the Democrats to approve it. We wanted to be bipartisan. As you know, you may have read a couple of things about China. I spoke to President Xi. Terrific president, a great leader of China, spoke to him this morning at length and we'll see what happens, but we are going to have a good deal and a fair deal or we're not going to have a deal at all and that's okay too."
"Because we are taking in billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and companies are leaving China because they want to avoid paying these large tariffs. And by the way, when the fake news tells you that you are paying, in the case of China, they devalue their currency, that helps them. And you know what else they're doing?"
"They're subsidizing those companies and you're not paying very much if you're paying anything at all, the case of China, and we are taking billions and billions of dollars in. And remember this, and you know it as well as I do, we have never taken in 10 cents from China, we would lose $500 billion a year with China."
"We rebuilt China. They've done a great job, but they took us for suckers, and that includes Obama and Biden. We took -- they took us for suckers. Five hundred billion, five hundred billion. Somebody said, ""You mean five hundred million."" That's a lot too, right? No, $500 billion, actually more than that, I don't want to be too specific 507. We're fighting against the same far left politicians that ravage our great cities and crush the dreams of African-American middle class, the same people who threw open our borders and allowed drugs, gangs, and illegal labor to devastate our poorest American communities, you know that."
"Our political opponents looked down with hatred on our values and with utter disdain for the people whose lives they want to run. That's the way they've been doing it and if you take a look at the African American community, how's -- how much progress has been made, the lowest unemployment numbers in the history of our country."
"They called you and us, do you remember this? They called us deplorables, that was a mistake. That was a big mistake. I'll never forget. I was making a speech after Hillary used the word deplorables, and I didn't think it was that bad, you know why? She used another word. You know what the other word was?"
"She said, deplorables and irredeemables. I think that was worse, but it didn't get picked up. You never know what's going to get picked up. It didn't. I think irredeemables is worst than deplorables, but I'll never forget. I was making a speech the next day. We had a big crowd in a great, great state, and women, in particular, were wearing: We are deplorables, The deplorables love you."
"And there were hundreds and hundreds of people wearing: We are deplorables, and I said, ""I think Hillary Clinton made a big mistake with that speech, and that is the problem with politics, one word and your career is ruined. You never know, you have to be very careful with the fakers back there. I have news for democrats who want to return us to the bitter failures and betrayals of the past."
"We are not going back we're going on to victory, going on to victory. [Inaudible] take it away as fast as it came, and as Mike Pence said a little while ago, ""That's why we want a little more time. It's going to be cemented, it's going to be cemented."" You know we have a big decision to make. You know what I'm going to say, ""We have to come up with a theme for the new campaign, right?"
"Is it going to be Make America Great Again, which is probably and possibly the greatest theme in the history of politics, I think. Make America Great Again, MAGA country, right? MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, we're in MAGA country, that I can tell you. But you know today we had a massive day on the stock market. A lot of good things are happening, but we had a very big day and we're very close to, I think, are 68 record."
"You know we've hit all time records. This tremendous, I think it's actually more than that, but it's a lot. So now I say, we've made America great again, but how do you give up the No. 1 call a theme, logo, statement in the history of politics for a new one, but you know there's a new one that really works and that's called Keep America Great, right?"
"Keep America Great, right? Keep America Great. In other words make America Great Again, well, we've really done it. We've rebuilt our military, it's still in the process. We've taken care of our vets. We've cut the hell out of regulations. You know, have cut more regulations than any president in the history of our country, regardless of the length of their term."
"So now I say, we need-- we have a lot of brilliant talent campaign people, they cost a fortune and they never give me any ideas. I'm only kidding. So now, I'm saying, what do we use as our theme as our statement, so I'm going to ask you to vote on it. I'm going to go, Make America Great Again and Keep America Great."
"Let me just here by your cheers, what you like. So, in all fairness, Make America Great, the greatest of all time. I really believe that. The greatest of all time, how do you give up the greatest of all time with a new theme, because you know what's gonna happen? If I do it with a new theme, I give up the greatest of all time and if I lose, people are going to say what a mistake that was, but we're not going to lose so it's not going to matter."
"We're not going to lose, right? We're not going to lose. Are you ready? First, we do make America Great Again, then we do Keep America Great. Let me hear it. Ready? Make America Great Again. Not bad. I would have said that three years ago, wouldn't be a contest, right? You're ready? Keep America Great. Wow, I'm sorry MAGA country, but that wasn't too close."
"I thought you had it won, and then I heard this cheer. My eardrums will never be the same. Keep America Great. We're going to keep on fighting for every man and woman and child all across this land. With every ounce of heart and mind, and sweat and soul, we're going to keep making America great again, and then we will indeed Keep America Great."
"I will keep it so great. Better than ever before. We're going to keep it better than ever before. And that is why tonight, I stand before you to officially launch my campaign for a second term as president of the United States. Thank you. I can promise you that I will never ever let you down. I won't. And I am profoundly thankful to my family."
"I have a great family Melania, Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, Barron, Lara, Jared, Robert, Maryanne, Elizabeth, and my late brother, Fred Jr., we're joined tonight by many great patriots who fight right by our side. Florida's terrific governor. Thank you, Ron. Our first lady, Casey DeSantis. What a job you are doing."
"Thank you. Thank you, Ron, Casey. Thank you. What a job. And again, your great lieutenant governor, who I hear is fantastic, right? Jeanette Núñez. Jeannette. Thank you, Jeanette. Beautiful job. Your Florida CFO, Jimmy Patronis. Some really brilliant, tough, wonderful friends who have helped me so much, Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Rick Scott of Florida."
"These are great people, they're tough, they're smart, and they love our country. Thank you very much. Rick, Marco, Lindsey, thank you. Members of Congress, warriors also. Boy, they're up there, you want them protecting you, I'll tell you. They don't stop. Matt Gaetz, Ted Yoho, and Michael Waltz. And also, all of our friends and our supporters, you've been incredible."
"This has been a tremendous night. You've really been incredible. Since the very first day I walked through the doors of the White House. I have never forgotten who sent me there, You did, you did, you did, you did, you did, you did, you all did. When I get behind my desk in the beautiful oval office, I think about only one thing: how the American people are going to win, win, win today."
"And I'm fighting for you, and I think you see that, not easy, but I love it and the reason I love it because there have been few presidents that have been able to do what we've been able to do for you, and it is a great great feeling, thank you. Thank you. I love it. Together, we're breaking the most sacred rule in Washington politics."
"We are keeping our promises to the American people, because my only special interest is you. I don't have a special interest, I don't care, I don't care. And by the way, by the way, a woman who has been so good, so talented, so wonderful and we're sort of going to be losing. I have a feeling she's going to be running for a certain gubernatorial position."
"Don't worry about it, Ron, it's not going to be his last. It won't be in Florida. I promise you, Casey. She'll be tough, right? But a woman who's, a special woman and right -- and her father, by the way, he's out there fighting for us all the time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders."
"Thank you, Mr. President. This has been truly the honor of a lifetime. One of the most incredible experiences anybody could ever imagine and that's because I've had the chance to be on the front row of history and watch you drastically change our country for the better. You've made America great, you're gonna continue to make America great."
"I couldn't be prouder to be part of your team. I'm gonna go spend a lot of time with my kids, but no one will be a stronger voice and a more fierce advocate for this president, because he's fighting for all of the people in this room and for all of the people that you represent all over the country and he's gonna have an incredible six more years to make our country as strong as it's ever been."
"Thank you so much, Mr. President."
"We're going to miss her. We're going to miss her. Thank you, Sarah. Incredible, a warrior. Since the election, we have created six million new jobs. Nobody thought that would be possible. They said it wouldn't be possible. We have lifted more than six million Americans off of food stamps and we're getting off of welfare and back into the workforce and they're so happy."
"They are so happy. The unemployment rate is the lowest rate it's been in over 51 years, think of that. And as I said before about African-American, I now say also about Hispanic.-American and Asian-American unemployment have reached the lowest rates in the history of our country. Unemployment. And African-American poverty has also reached, by far, the lowest rate in history."
"These are incredible numbers. And today, right now, as we speak, almost 160 million people are working, that's more than ever before, it's the first time ever, the number of people is almost 160 million and we're going to be breaking that number soon. Women filled 60% of the new jobs created last year and women's unemployment is now the lowest it's been in 74 years."
"Wages are rising at the fastest rate in many decades, and really what's nice is they're rising the fastest for the lowest income Americans. Isn't that nice? Percentage wise, the Fed and our pledge to the American worker through Ivanka Trump, she has worked so hard, she's worked hard, has secured commitments to provide private-sector training opportunities to nearly 10 million Americans."
"It's been an incredible story. It's been an incredible story. Great job. To get relief to working families, we passed the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in American history, the largest. We doubled, the child-tax credit, and the typical family of four earning $75,000 has seen a tax cut of over $2,000 a year, and that money goes right back into our economy."
"Our record-breaking regulatory reduction campaign has saved every American household an average of $3,000 per year, and we've ended the last administration's cruel and heartless law on American energy. What they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten. The United States is now the No.1 producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world."
"And something I want to make clear to the media, we have among the cleanest and sharpest, crystal-clean, you've heard me say it, I went crystal-clean air and water anywhere on Earth. We are creating a future of American energy independence and yet our air and water are the cleanest they've ever been by far, and importantly, we are reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."
"When I came into office, we inherited one of the worst trade deals ever negotiated, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Would it put you all out of work? TPP would have dealt the death blow to the US auto industry, which, by the way is doing great. Many, many plants are now under construction in Michigan and Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, they hadn't built one in decades and now they're all over the place."
"In my first week, I withdrew the United States from the job-killing catastrophe that we know what that is: TPP and the Paris environmental accord, not too good, not too good. I thought I was going to take a lot of heat on that, I took none. Would have cost us trillions and trillions of dollars. And we're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the brand new USMCA."
"And USMCA, that's Mexico and Canada, will create at least 75,000 new jobs for American auto workers and give a massive boost to our farmers and ranchers, and growers all across the Sunshine State and will hopefully soon have bipartisan support. Because everybody wants it to happen. It replaces one of the worst trade deals ever made, NAFTA."
"NAFTA was a beauty. It was really good if you want to see everybody leave our country. Thanks to our tariffs, american steel mills are roaring back to life, you know that. And we've taken historic action to confront china's chronic trading abuses. It should have been done a long time ago, but the days of stealing American jobs and American companies, American ideas and wealth, those days are over."
"In the eight years before I took office, on average, we lost two thousand manufacturing jobs a month. Since my inauguration, we've added 16,000 manufacturing jobs a month. That didn't happen by accident. Remember the statement from the previous administration you'd need a magic wand to bring back manufacturing."
"Well, we'll tell sleepy Joe that we found the magic wand. The sleepy guy. And to remedy past injustices, we passed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. We ended the Clinton era crime policies that unfairly affected the African-American community, so unfair. We are boldly confronting the opioid and drug addiction, and you know what's happening, drug addiction is the scorch of our country and many other countries, and we have made so much progress, so much progress."
"Opioid down 17, 18, 19, and 21% in some places. And I want to thank our first lady for having worked so hard on that, thank you, thank you. And we're expanding, affordable health care, creating plans 60% cheaper than Obamacare, and we passed, something I'm very proud of, they've wanted to pass it for 45 years."
"All of the gentlemen that are sitting here from Congress, your congressmen, your senators, they helped us. It's called Right To Try. We have the greatest medical labs in the world. We have incredible things under advisement, and our people, if they were very sick, they were terminally ill. They couldn't get anything because people said no, it might hurt them, they're terminally ill."
"So I said that doesn't make sense, and these people, if they were rich or had money they'd go to Asia, they'd go to Europe, they'd go all over the world looking for a cure, because the FDA would not approve what we call Right To Try, what a beautiful name, Right To Try, and I got it approved after 44 years, I got it approved."
"And I saw a beautiful young woman the other day on television, Miss Harp, incredible woman. Did anyone see her? She was incredible, and she was so thankful that she's doing so well and they were giving her instructions on what you do when you're dying, and then all of a sudden this happened, and now it looks like she's going to be around for a long time, and there are many, many cases right there."
"Right To Try. And I hope nobody in this room ever needs it, but we now have it. For the first time in half a century, we've reduced the price of prescription drugs and our amazing veterans are no longer left to languish and die on endless waiting lists, standing on line waiting for a doctor. We pass V.A. Choice, so they can see their doctor."
"Our veterans were waiting on line for two days, seven days, three weeks, five weeks, you had veterans waiting on line that could have easily been taken care of. They waited so long. they became terminally ill in many cases, the stories are horrible. We passed V.A. choice. You go out now, you get a doctor, you fix yourself up, the doctor sends us the bill, we pay for it, and you know what it doesn't matter, because the life and the veteran is more important, but we also happen to save a lot of money doing that, can you believe it? V.A. Choice for the veteran."
"They've been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years. Now we also passed V.A. accountability so that when somebody does bad things or mistreats, our wonderful veterans, we couldn't do anything with them. They were protected between civil service unions and all of the problems, it didn't matter, you couldn't do anything."
"Now, you can just say, ""You're fired, get out, get out, get out."" And as we fight to make life better for all Americans, the Democrat Party has become more radical, more dangerous and more unhinged than at any point in the modern history of our country or no issue are Democrats more extreme and more depraved than when it comes to border security."
"The Democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible. It's the greatest betrayal of the American middle class and, frankly, American life. Our country, has a hole, nobody sees anything like it, people are pouring in, but we've stopped them, and now, as I said, we have other people helping us, including the country of Mexico."
"Let's see how it works out, but we need you to call your Democrat Congressman and your Democrat Senator and get them to pass legislation. Working with these great men over here to close up the loopholes and to solve the asylum problem which can be done in 15 minutes. Illegal mass migration brings in millions of low wage workers to compete for jobs, wages and opportunities against the most vulnerable Americans cutting off their path to the American dream."
"Thanks to Democrat policies, schoolchildren across the country are being threatened by the vicious gang MS-13. That iCE, by the way, is taking out of our country and dropping them back home by the thousands, by the thousands. Mass illegal migration, reduces living standards and strains public resources. If Democrat officials had to send their children to those overcrowded overburdened schools, they would not tolerate it for one minute."
What's happening with their policies are horrible. Our immigration laws are a disgrace and the Democrats can get together with the Republicans and solve the problem quickly. One meeting. Democrats in California even voted to give free health care to illegal aliens instead of helping homeless Americans in Democrat run cities.
"Democrats support sanctuary cities. Thank you, Governor Ron, for ending that whole disaster. They release dangerous criminal aliens into our communities. Ron DeSantis, great job. Great. Really great, thank you. So small. It's commonsense. It's commonsense. Sanctuary cities are an open attack on American law enforcement and American families."
"Sacrificing American lives in pursuit of a callous political agenda. That's all it is. No one who supports sanctuary cities should be allowed to run for president of the United States, Republicans believe welfare, schools, hospitals, and public resources should be protected for all Americans. And yes, yes, we are doing things that few others have even tried to do we are making progress like nobody would believe."
"Wait 'til you see some of the things that you're going to be hearing about over the next few months. We believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding citizens not for criminal aliens, and we will always support and protect the heroes of ICE border patrol and law enforcement generally throughout our country."
"Thank you. And in the ultimate act of moral cowardice, not one Democrat candidate for president, not a single one, has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ICE and border patrol, the job they do is incredible, against all odds with the bad laws. They don't have the character, the virtue, the spine to do it, we have to thank them and we have to thank, boy, law enforcement."
"What a job they do. It's time to pass Kate's Law, end sanctuary cities, end catch and release, deport vicious gang members, which we're doing, stop human trafficking, stop illegal immigration, and establish a modern immigration system based on skills contributions and based on merit. We want people to come into our country based on merit more than 120 Democrats in Congress have also signed up to support crazy Bernie Sanders socialist government takeover of healthcare."
"He seems not to be doing too well lately. They want to end Medicare as we know it and terminate the private health insurance of 180 million Americans who love their health insurance. America will never be a socialist country, ever. Republicans do not believe in socialism, we believe in freedom, and so do you."
"We will defend Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. We will defend it like nobody else. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. Virtually, every top Democrat also now supports taxpayer-funded abortion right up to the moment of birth. Ripping baby straight from the mother's womb, leading Democrats have even opposed measures to prevent the execution of children after birth."
"You saw that. In Virginia, republicans believe that every life is a sacred gift from God. That is why I have asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion. Day by day, we are rebuilding our country, our home, we are restoring America's standing all around the world. We are respected as a country again."
"After past leaders slash military budgets, we are rebuilding the U.S armed forces with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year, far more than ever before. And with the help of Vice President Mike Pence, we are creating the space force, that's where it's going to be, the space force. We're insisting that our foreign partners and allies pay their fair share, and thanks to our brave warriors, the ISIS caliphate that you've been hearing so much about, has been totally obliterated 100%. We have repaired America's friendship with our cherished ally, the state of Israel."
"And as I heard, Mike, saying before, we recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and we recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. And I withdrew the United States from the disaster -- i's a disaster, a disaster, the disastrous Iran nuclear deal and imposed the toughest ever sanctions on the world's No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism."
"We're charting a path to stability and peace in the Middle East, because great nations do not want to fight endless wars. They've been going on forever. Starting to remove a lot of troops. We're finally putting America first. In Latin America, our country once again stands against corrupt communist and socialist regimes, and we support the people of Cuba and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom."
"Thank you, Marco. Thank you, Rick. Thank you, Lindsey. And nothing would make us happier than to be able to work with Democrats to rebuild our nation's infrastructure, to bring down drug prices, to compete with other countries and to dominate the future as one American team. It can happen. It can happen, it can happen."
"It's looking like the Democratic Party does not want to do that, but it can happen, and it very well might. There's so many great things we can do right now in a bipartisan way, but they've been afflicted with an ideological sectors that protects foreign borders, but refuses to protect our borders that promotes jobs overseas, but allows our factories to close, that promotes democracy abroad, but shreds our Constitution at home."
"That declares support for free speech and free thought, but relentlessly suppresses them both and that constantly savages the heroes of American law enforcement. We don't want that, we don't want that. No matter what label they use. A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream."
"So don't ever forget, this election is about you. It's about your family, your future and the fate of your country. We begin our campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, and the only positive vision for our country's future. Together, we will continue unleashing the power of American enterprise, so every American can know the dignity of work and the pride of a paycheck."
"We will elect a Republican Congress to create a safe, modern, and lawful system of immigration. It will be a system of immigration that strengthens our country, upholds our values and protects our way of life. We will enact trade deals that ensure more products are promptly stamped with the words Made in the U.S.A. We will create a great health care system based on honesty, transparency, more options, and far lower costs for much better care."
"We will give school choice to millions of underserved children who are trapped in failing schools and failing school system. We will continue rescuing our inner cities from disastrous reign of Democrats, who presided over the decimation of their education systems, the outsourcing of their jobs, and the devastation of their neighborhoods."
"We will expand opportunity zones so that no community is ever left behind. Thank you, Tim Scott, great help. In the face of new threats, we will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. We will protect our Second Amendment. We will push onward with new medical frontiers."
"We will come up with the cures to many, many problems, to many, many diseases, including cancer and others, and we're getting closer all the time. We will eradicate AIDS in America once and for all and we're very close. We will lay the foundation for landing American astronauts on the surface of Mars and, above all, we will never stop fighting for the values that hold us together."
"As one America, we believe in the American Constitution and the rule of law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag, and we will live by the words of our national motto: In God we Trust."
"Powered by these values, we won a victory two and a half years ago, we won a victory for every parent worried for their children and worried about their children. They were concerned that their children wouldn't have the same opportunity as they had, we're going to make that opportunity even better. We won a victory for every mom and dad who lost a job, because our leaders wave the white flag of economic surrender, you've seen that too much."
"We won a victory for American self-government, self rule and self determination. We have been blessed by God with the greatest nation on the face of the earth and we are going to keep it that way. We are going to keep it that way. With your help, with your love and your devotion and with your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning."
"We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. And together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you, Orlando. Thank you. Florida."
"So we meet in Oklahoma. We begin. Thank you Oklahoma, and thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin -- we begin our campaign. We begin our campaign, and I just want to thank all of you. You are warriors. I've been watching. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative, don't go, don't come, don't do anything."
"Today was like -- I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors. Thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside. They were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma, and I hear I hear from your two great Senators, your new Governor, that we're doing very well in Oklahoma."
"That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Why does he get a pass from these people? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion and creed."
"Republicans are the party of liberty equality and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done, we will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time. That's an all time record. I've said all time record."
"I've always heard how important judges are now. We know how important they are, think of that over 300, Around 300 by the. Under the term and when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number, very important November 3rd and two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court justice scores such justice cabinet, they're great, they are -- they're great, we have two and we could get a few more."
"We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States military and all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarine. Or missiles or rockets or jet fighters bombers, it's all built in the USA, We passed a choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator?"
"Jim Inhofe you better vote for him, he's running, he's great, but we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second. Two great Senators, you have two great Senators, so we passed a choice. So if you're a veteran for years and years, they've wanted to do it from us. 50 years, we got it done, we get a lot of things done."
"And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait in line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay you Bill, we take care of the Bill, we take care of the Bill and you get immediate service."
"It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A is now 91 percent. That's so good. It's never been anywhere near that number ever been anywhere near that number. And V.A accountability with a lot of bad people in the V.A people that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic people that stole a lot of bad people."
"You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say, it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades. They wanted to get it changed. And I got it. With those people and your Congressman a Congressman who I'm going to v.A accountability and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and why do we say we say You're fired get out, greg, they got rid of a lot of bad people that were There for a long time of like me in Washington draining the swamp, I never knew it was so deep, but it's happening."
"It's happening. I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals that finally finally after all these years put."
"America first I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cut in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes, tell me about that, tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned, you know, all my life, all my life. I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise it. If you could lower them, you couldn't lose the Democrats, want to substantially raise your taxes."
"How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our -- and with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great. State of Oklahoma, you ever notice said Biden, no. Do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong?"
"He's in Iowa. He says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa, he's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire that happens to me all the time hasn't happened to me yet. You know when that happens there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speeches are, but we just turn the United States into the dominant energy superpower of the world of the world and because of. The Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were -- and I got it back together, I called Russia, I called right, I called Russia, I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico."
"Mexico is a little bit tough that's called opiate plus. Did you ever hear of opiate plus that's OPEC Plus plus and we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business almost $40 a barrel a couple of months ago was Zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs, so Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and many other states would have been hurt."
"Now you think you're going to be hurt there, you try putting AOC in charge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No President or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration."
"Not even our incredible success in rebuilding America stands in stark contrast to the extremism and destruction and violence of the radical left. We just saw it outside. We just saw it outside. You saw these thugs that came along these people call them protesters, isn't it beautiful? It's so beautiful, not so wonderful, they call him the Boston Tea Party."
"That's so wonderful, yeah, they call you ever watch a fake, do CNN, you ever watch. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shaved job in the head, which is fine and he's standing in front of a building saying things are very peaceful here at the building is it looks like the biggest fire I've ever Seen in the whole town is burning, it looks like the biggest fire in Houston."
"Things are very good here. Anderson, I think it's -- I think he's A wonderful people, Ms. Like the world was coming to an end and you know we did something in Minneapolis after watching the three or four days I called and said you got to get out, you can't protect yourselves. I got them to take 1,000. National Guardsmen and in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks without power and we did the same thing in other cities, but how about Seattle?"
"So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean we're not talking about some little place. We're talking about Seattle, have you ever been to Seattle, they took over a big chunk and the governor who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat. You know that every one of everyone and I have an offer out, I said anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less now."
"I may be wrong. But it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great Congressmen who were going to introduce in a second and I said to him Congressman what do you think? I can straighten it out fast. You would just go in. No sir, let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical Left democrats will do to our country, but Americans have watch Left, wing radicals burned down, buildings loot businesses destroy private property."
"In your hundreds of dedicated police offers, these police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible and injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was and they never talk about covered. They don't talk about what you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue are walking down the street of a Democrat run city."
"You never hear them saying they're not wearing the mask. You don't hear them say as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they're saying what a terrible thing for a President to say what a terrible thing, but you don't hear them talking about code red Corvette."
"To be specific, 19, that name gets further and further away from China as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. Despite the fact that we -- I Have done a phenomenal job with it. I shut down the United States to a very heavily infected, but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it if they would have done it at all I say hundreds of thousands of lives."
"We don't ever get even a mention then I closed it down to Europe, early, closed it down because I saw what was happening by the way most people said don't do it. Don't do it, we saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible at what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment and with testing you know testing is a double edged sword."
"We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot south Korea's not alone. They call me, they said the job you're doing. Here's the bad part when you test of when you do testing to that extent you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases."
"So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests that people don't know what's going on. We got tests. We got another one over here, the young man 10 years old. He's got the sniffles he's recovered about. Your immune system, they don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please open open the schools, we got ta, get them open in the fall, we got ta get them open, the unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history desecrating our monuments, our beautiful monuments tear down our statues and punish cancel and Persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control, we're not conforming."
"That's why we're here actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments. Think of that, I heard it for the first time two weeks ago, I said well that one I've been there only kidding."
"I said there on did not Minneapolis zoo what's going on. They're not getting -- they got a lot of problems. They'll have a lot of rub. It's one o'clock in the morning and they're very tough. You know, I've used the word on occasion, Embry, a very tough operator is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or what."
"However, he may do and you call nine, one one and they say, I'm sorry, this numbers no longer working. By the way. You have many cases like that many, many, many, whether it's a young woman or an old woman, a young man or an old man. And you're slipping, so what are you going to do, right? So they wanted to fund, they really do. This is a serious movement and in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it in Seattle, you see what's going on there."
"It's even worse. okay. These people are stone cold crazy. So if you want to save your heart, you want to save that beautiful heritage of ours. We have a great heritage. We're a great country, you are so lucky, I'm President. That's all I can tell. People have come up to me and say how do you take it? I say, do I have a choice?"
"Do I have a choice? We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning and every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit, left and Right left and Right like even this great event. What if you could have seen that side of -- you could have heard the reports, the reports? Oh, it's Cold, it's this."
"I've gotten this far the way it's a disease without question has more names than any disease. I can name kung flu. I can name 19 different versions of them, many, call it a virus, which it is many, call it a flu. What difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name, but they say here do you get the energy?"
"I say I don't have a choice, I don't have a choice. You know it was interesting to show you how fake they are. You might have seen it. So last week they called me and they say sure west Point West Point, we're ready, I said, Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point, you know they delayed it for six weeks because of covered, so they delayed it and then went there 1,000, 106 cadets were graduated and beautiful."
"Beautiful guitar, so just to show you how bad the fake jerseys. So they said to me sir, we're ready to go. I say let's go, this is after saying hello to a lot of good dads, inspecting little areas of a building that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old, so I did a lot of our great general -- some of our Presidents that went there west Point is beautiful right on the Hudson River, but after an hour General that runs, it is fantastic."
"After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and there's a -- Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am. So we walk like the equivalent of about 3 blocks, which is fine. We go on stage which is fine. They make speeches that I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know, but a long time for some."
"Is pouring down on me okay, But they said to me before the speech, sir, would you like to salute each cadet each single cadet or maybe they'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute like this, yes, like this almost 600 times, you know that is 600 time. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times you go home and you say yes, it's like a workout without a weight, right, 600 times."
"So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand, new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought. So they fly over and the kids throw the hats in the. If it really is, it was a beautiful day and we're all finished. I was on the stage for hours, hours son. I came home."
"I had a nice tan, meaning Meaning I had a nice sunburn because the sun's gone all right like that. But I make this speech right, I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that watch, if I'm off like two minutes, I'll say he exaggerated it was only an hour and twenty five minutes, he exaggerated, he lied, he lied."
"He's a liar. These people are sick the fake so then, so then I finish saluting my final salute, I said thank goodness. Thank you very much. But think of it so essentially almost 600 times. Now the generals as Sir are you ready, sir, I'm ready. General, where are we going now after just that I left early in the morning to get there."
"Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know he said Sir, we can now leave the stage, I say great. General, let's go -- I'll follow you and he goes like this right here sir. And the stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably ten yards long I say general."
"I'm -- I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their President. I did this big thing. I love them. I do love them. They're incredible. They do. I said General, I've got myself a problem General because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes, which is good. If you're walking on flat surfaces, it's not good for ramps."
"And if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at it, and this was a steel round, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp, it had no handrail. It was like an ice skating rink. And I said General, I have a problem and he didn't understand that at first. I said there's no way get us there."
"I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech I set for other speeches. Being baked and being baked like a cake, I said General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass general, I have no really true. So I said Is there like something else around, sir? The Wrap is ready to go. Grab me, sir, grab me. I didn't really want to grab him."
"You don't like -- as I said, that'll be a story to -- so now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep really, Really, Really it's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said General get ready, cause I may grab yourself first because."
"I can't fall with the fake, does watch if I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, you remember I remember when another President nice man threw up in Japan and they did slow motion replays through, right. It's true. I don't want that General now. He's standing there big, strong guy and he's got his shoes, but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I look -- the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes that I looked at mine very, very slippery."
"So I end up saying okay, General, let's go, I will only grab you if I need you, that's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster, it turned out to be worse than anything I would have been better off. I fell and slid down the damn ramp, right? So, So what happens is I start the journey inch by inch, right?"
"And I was really bent over to -- I didn't like that. You know, I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers, so I was bent over and then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most is honest human beings they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said General -- I'm sorry, man and I ran down the restaurant."
"I said to our great First Lady, I said -- let me ask you a question, was it that good the speech that I'm trending, number one, because I felt it was really good. No, no, they don't even mentioned the speech. They mentioned the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease or stroke. It's -- They say there's something wrong with our President."
"I'll let you know if there's something wrong. Okay, I'll let you know if there's something I'll tell you what. There's something wrong with Biden that I could. So then my wife said, well, it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water, I said, Yeah, I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit."
"You know, you're drinking for your working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this this way, they say when lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said What does it have to do with water? They said you couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water."
"I said I just saluted 600 times like this and this was before I saluted. So what's the problem? She said, Well, I know what you did. You had on a very good red tongue that's the sort of expensive itself because they -- they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie and I don't want to drink much."
"So I lifted up the water. I see we have a little glass of water where the hell did this water come from. Where did it come from? And I looked down on my tie because I've done it, I've taken water and it spills down and you tie it. Does it look good for a long time? And frankly, the tie is never the same."
"So I put it up to my lip. But then I say because I don't want it, that's just a case and they gave me another disease, they gave me another disease. Anyway, that's a long story, but here's the story. I have lived with more the ramp than the water, but I've lived with the ramp in the water since I left West Point, not one media Group said."
"I made a good speech or I made a great speech, but the kids loved it because they broke their barrier, which wasn't good in terms of convincing. But they broke that barrier and they wanted to shake hands they wanted. And I don't want to tell anybody, but there are a couple of kids they put out there end."
"I actually shook their hand okay, I actually support friends, they were excited. They were excited. They're with their President. They were excited, the most beautiful young people. Man, women, the most beautiful young people you've ever seen. So think of how you feel, give me I go there, how did I do sir?"
"That was a great speech. You know all my people, sir. I was one of your best. I was great. I say that's great. I agree. It was a good speech. I liked that speech. They don't mention the speech, but they have been going down this ramp at an ancient time. It's so unfair, it really so unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on Earth."
"They're bad people, bad okay. That's enough that I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story, the left wing, anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance."
"Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down that beautiful Christopher Columbus or all of a sudden a circle that thing. They didn't do too well and hurting. Christopher did they thank you to our Italian population. We're very proud of two days ago leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire, democrat, them all Democrat."
"Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know, we ought to do some. Mr Senators we have two great Senators. We ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year, one year. Jim and James, Jim and James, we ought to do it. You know, they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing, david."
"We used to have things and we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open. So everything and look what happens, we should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it, but just burn it, they go to jail for one year. okay. In Seattle, the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist."
"These are anarchists. These are not protesters. You listen to the fake news, they say the protesters were lovely. Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle, they'd have machine guns out to get them. But these people can take over the city look at what they've done to business people that have spent years and years building their business."
"And now they're wiped out, take it away, governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there. I'll help you. I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call. I would love to do it. I would love to do it. It'll take -- it'll take less than an hour, and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back."
"English Lit people that are very smart, say it, joe Biden said and they're going to this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say Joe didn't say that Joe doesn't even understand it. And if Biden is elected, he will surrender your country to these mobsters hundred percent. You are for one case by the way look at how we're doing in the stock market, just set another record with Nasdaq."
"Nasdaq, you're for one case and money itself will be worthless. You for one case are doing very well unless I don't want to see if you were stupid, I said don't sell, don't sell, it went down, but we got it back up and now NASA said, Think of it, Nasdaq just set a record. And I think you're going to see a lot of records and next year if we don't do anything stupid on November 3rd, you are going to have the greatest economic year we've ever had."
"That will be the -- if the Democrats gain power, then the rioters will be in charge and no one will be safe and no one will have control. Joe Biden is not the leader of his party. Joe Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left and he's not radical left. I don't think he knows what he is anymore, but he was never radical left, but he is controlled by the radical left and now he's really controlled."
"His campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravage Minneapolis. They bailed them out. They put up a lot of money to bail them out, the rioters and looters, and they were -- they were the arsonists. So they'll say, oh, it's terrible. What he says about the people of our nation, maybe some of them aren't even from our nation."
"The left is trying to do everything they can to stop us every hour of every day, including even violence and mayhem. They'll do anything they can to stop us. Look, what happened tonight, look at what happened tonight, law enforcement said, Sir, they can't have -- they can't be outside, it's too dangerous."
"We had a bunch of maniacs come and sort of attack our city, the mayor and the governor did a great job, but they were very violent people and our people are not nearly as vile. But if they ever were, it would be a terrible, terrible day for the other side because I know our people, I know our -- but we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation what they did tonight."
"I saw it on television coming in on Air Force One. One thing about Air Force One, we got plenty of televisions. We have televisions in closets, you open up the closet, got a television. We got a lot of televisions to great playing great everything by the way, we ordered new ones. No President wanted to do it. They thought it was luxuries, wait a minute, air Force One is 31 years old, people don't realize that."
"So I said they gave me a job very early in my administration like how about the first week, sir, would you sign for this plan now it's actually two planes. Would you sign for this plan air Force One, I said How old is the original or the one we have now search 31, 32 years and I'd see people coming in from foreign lands."
"It can't compete with us rich countries, but they can't compete with you and they have a brand new beautiful 747-800, 747 And I said wait a minute that country has new and we have a thirty one year. So somebody had to do so. The deal was made and it was made for a lot of money. I think it was 5.7 or 5.6 billion."
"Now in all fairness, it's two planes and there's a lot of stuff in those planes I won't talk to you about. So I told Boeing the head of Boeing, they said sir, please. We'd like to get started in the planes I said I do too, but I'm not paying five point, 6 billion and I'm not paying four point 6 billion. I said it has to have a three on the front of it. That's a hell of a lot of money too, but it is a rather complex situation."
"They said no way no way. This was before Boeing had problems by the way, but Boeing's coming back, they're coming back greatest company in the world. That's a big problem. It had a couple of problems that didn't work out that was terrible, but the greatest I think before that it was the greatest company in the world."
"It made up a quarter one quarter of a point of our GDP. Think how big that is one company, it was an unbelievable machine and then they made a plane and they did some foolish things and it's a terrible thing happened and all of a sudden they've gone through hell. But you know what, they're coming back. We're ready to help them if they need it, but they're coming back and becoming -- but this was the Boeing before that and they were riding high and like I was before, this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what on November 3rd. We're going to win with, so they came in and they came in and they said no, no, no, we won no way five point, 6 billion, whatever it was, whatever it was."
"If I'm a little bit off, they'll go crazy or whatever, but it was a lot five. Point six, nope got to have a three, got over 3 called me up, don't cancel the contract. I said cancel the contract. I want to cancel. I said General, can you cancel the contract? You said, yes, sir. I'm very proud of it. Oh, good cancel it. Okay, sir."
"By the way, to cancel it, you have to pay anything. Yes, sir. We have a cancellation fee, sir, how much is a general $250 million, sir. I said what sir, we made a good deal 250 million to you mean if we don't buy the plane, we have to handle 250 million that's not good, right. Look at these two guys are looking."
"That's like a good story compared to some I could tell you like with aircraft carriers. So they said 250 million or I always say this or around that number because I'm -- I'm off by a little bit, they say, oh, he exaggerates. I look at numbers all day long, that's when I look at four years down for my whole life when you think of it 250 million cancellation fee, sir, he was very proud of himself."
"What a great I see general don't cancel, don't cancel. Just tell him, I don't want the planes don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing general, why sir? Because I don't want to pay 250. Do you hear that? Jim? Jim Inhofe is great. You hear that. Jim, you know that story. He does a great job."
"So here's what happened. The bottom line, Boeing says no way, no way no way. The next week they say no way we're doing it the next week they said how about 5 billion? I said No way no way the next week. They say 4.8, I said, nope, it's got out have three on the front of the Don't you understand. You dumb son of a bitch don't you understand, I turned out to be right, you know, turned out to be right."
"Nobody gets that. No, got to have a three next day. They come back four. Point five is our best offer, nope, I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it come back when you're ready, a month goes by another month, they never heard about it. They never heard from me. They thought I was serious. I was and they came back at $4 billion."
"That's a lot of money. But I save like a billion. Six or billion seven, nobody wants to talk about. Nobody wants to talk about when I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars. Nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries, because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example."
"I mean I have a German heritage like some of you I said, let's get it down from fifty thousand twenty five thousand because they're delinquent for many years delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1 percent instead of 2 percent and 2 percent is a very low number and they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current."
"I said no. Angola, Angola players don't say that. We -- It's true, you know what I'm talking about, nice by the way, very nice well, I'm a very good negotiator. I said Angela, that's a long time. This was in 2019. She said 2032I should no longer let us down working. But I said What about because now they want to get current, but I said Well, what about the last twenty five years, all the money you owe us, everybody forgot about that."
"They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said What about the trillion dollars that you really owe. So we're negotiating, let's see. But in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this -- remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for energy coming from a pipeline brand new pipeline."
"So they pay the country, we're supposed to protect them from. They pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect. Scuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Ted, James Lankford likewise when they just said they love your jokes when they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it, they get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off."
"We're ripped up by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They know there are a lot of people that don't want me, you know, they don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right. It's called the Military Industrial Complex when rioting and looting broke out in our nation's capital."
"I very quickly deployed the National Guard, I said get them in. After watching for an evening or two, we stop the violence and restore peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little break out. Again, they ripped down a statue that was one hundred and ten years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with a radical left Mayor watching on television, but not happy that's going to be very expensive for D. C... They're always looking for money."
"We need more money, we always need more money and then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor, Bowser, mayor Bowser. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great beautiful Jefferson Memorial not going to happen, don't worry about."
"We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want a ballot before the left wing mob or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans and explain this to the NFL? I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said Where did that come from in the middle of the summer."
"Nobody is even asking. We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL, The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those? It took him a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that."
"You know a lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said these are super left liberals and they didn't like it. Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro America rally."
"They want to punish you thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone -- and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders, nobody's coming. And they want to abolish ice are great people from ICE who send the roughest, toughest meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard."
"Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help ICE. They're rough guys. They're rough, they're great Americans elect, but they'll walk in, take him in a pack, they'll walk into a pack of tough MS 13 gang members. And you know, we shouldn't say this."
"It's not nice. They want us to negotiate, they start swinging. And the other starts where everybody's swinging at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon, right? They're great. And these people want to get rid of ice, they get rid of murderers, they get rid of rapists, they get rid of the worst scum on earth."
"And when I call them animals, I said they're animals and Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend cut him up with a knife because it was more painful. Dad cut him up with a knife because it's more painful, takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut him up. I said these are animals and Nancy Pelosi said these are human beings are not animals."
"If I lose an election over that you know what this country's in big trouble, big trouble. They want to disarm law abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS 13 gang members in Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizen."
"That's true in my administration. We defend American citizens and we deport Hamas 13 members or put him in jail if we have to the chaos you're seeing in our Democratic run cities. These are all run by the Democrats is what will happen in every city and community. In America and much, much worse if we don't keep them out, we have to do this."
"We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest you know what to do. You know what to do got to keep the White House joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decade. Betrayal calamity and failure, he never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President and he was before that something guy, you know it's great President Trump was tough on this or he was to complain, never did anything about he's been there for 43 years of forty seven years."
"He never did anything about it. Biden supported every globalist attack on the American worker. Let's make every country in the world, rich, but ourselves including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go in. TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal that was a Hillary Clinton special."
"I was a Hillary Clinton supporter. She said we have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs and she was right for South Korea, 250,000 and China's entry into the World Trade Organization was a. Bordered by sleepy, Joe Biden, that was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country."
"When China joined the World Trade Organization, they became -- they were flatlined for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and require -- he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens okay."
"When I took early decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus, and as I said, Joe Biden opposed my decision and called it hysteria xenophobia, he does know what the word means, xenophobia and fear mongering and. Apologized a month later he said he was wrong, but he didn't say it and they didn't cover it. They didn't cover on one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime."
"Joe Biden sided with China over America that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember this was all this was in January, that's early, real early the end of January, he thought it was a terrible thing when we closed the border to many people that were badly infected with Kevin. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left."
"He'll always vow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family. And you know that joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history at my direction early this year, the heroes. The US military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer and leader of ISIS, Al Baghdadi and the number one terrorist anywhere in the world, kSM Souleymane, we took him out."
"Joe Biden opposed killing Charlemagne. He was vehemently. We killed his number one terrorist. He didn't like it, you know why he didn't like it becaUSe he thought it would be good politically that didn't work out too well just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, he opposed it. You know that Biden is always on the wrong side of history as said by people that are with him and worked with him."
"He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with one point, 5 billion. I think it's a little bit allowing. To rip off America for many years now, they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty left over china's not exactly happy with being billions, they pay us billions and billions of dollars and they targeted our great farmers and I took the money that they targeted."
"I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay, are you okay. Come Doctor, please doctor. Thank you. These people, I mean some of the people are waiting for five days, especially at this location, right? You take your time, take your time. Thank you very much. Iran, President Obama gave them one hundred and fifty billion dollars for nothing and almost more incredibly."
"He gave them one point, 8 billion in green cash, beautiful and now they're not doing so well, are they -- they're not doing so someday we're going to get credit for this someday, but they are waiting. Iran wants to make a deal so badly, but they're told by Kerry and all these other -- they shouldn't The Logan Act, but they're told by Kerry and all these people wait because if Trump loses, you'll own America, you're going to own it, they'll say you own it. So I don't mind, I told them we could wait, but when I win, you're going to pay a much higher price than if you made a deal for."
"And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his sons paid 83,000 a month and he was -- jobless give me a break 83,000 a month more than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become President and emboldened left to launch a full scale assault on American life, you know that they'll expel anyone who disagrees with them."
"Look, what happens when you disagree, you use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist, they call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty, they don't want religion silence, religious believers, indoctrinate, your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country subsidize late term, abortion and after birth execution."
"They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment. As sure as you're sitting in fact, even put the big gun grabber below a rock who made a fool out of himself when he ran for President, they put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember, I said and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much because it won't matter."
"Hopefully it won't matter. No bed or Rock who wants to give up guns is in charge of the Second Amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance ban fracking, that's not good and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before and that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far and they went to a point."
"Somebody two days ago said Sir, the elite are really working hard or trying to destroy you. I said Yeah, what do you call them the elite? I said Why well I just been -- it did not lead. I look better than them much more handsome, got better here than they do. It's Got nicer properties. I got nicer houses, I got nicer apartments."
"I got nicer everything I read for politics once just once in my life and I became President of the United. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them. About three or four more times, we want to -- we'll do it one more time, we'll be two for two and our country will never ever be stronger."
"But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court and I'll choose only from that list 100 percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, anyone of which -- and I did it last time. And people loved one, I did it and I'll only pick from that list."
"Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical. People people don't understand, but we actually won on Dhaka yesterday. We actually won because they basically said you won, but you have to come back and redo it. It's almost like, Gee, come on back."
"Your paperwork was no good, but we're going to be refiling. But don't let it get you -- everything's gonna work out really good, everything's good. It was great. It was great. I mean, it would have been nice if we won. And everybody said, oh, you got to win, you got to win Dhaka, that's easy. You got to win Dhaka, that's easy."
"They all said it and they came back. And they said we don't like what you did with your paperwork essentially. So we're refiling it. Most people would say, oh, we lost it is going to refile it and everything is gonna work out for the young people, most of whom aren't so young anymore by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody."
"Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it, he insults socialist. Alexandria Cascio Cortez to be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free?"
"Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing, Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy and you know what that means. She does even want wind."
"She does it, she doesn't want those bird killing machines to go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead go under a windmill, sometime she wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue, you know it, but she's in charge of the environment, no aeroplanes we can forget Boeing, I guess come to think of it right."
"We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing, let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones right. Likewise, Representative E. hon, Ilan, Omar, ilan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America bashing, Socialist Front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country."
"I don't think so. I would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, somalia no government, no safety, no police, no, nothing just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No, thank you. And I think -- I think we're gonna have a big victory in the state of Minnesota because they've had a -- they've had -- biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism when Biden first ran for President over thirty three years ago."
"Remember, I used to call him 1 percent Joe and never got more than 1 percent until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America."
"Joe Biden. Is a shameless hypocrite since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral and at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK. And yet Biden is now smearing as racists. Tens of millions of people like yourselves, decent hardworking Americans who he's never met and frankly probably doesn't want to meet america, should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden's, sleepy, Joe, a man who praised and partied with segregationist shift millions of black American jobs overseas."
"And everyone else's jobs too, by the way, if I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything and there's never been a comeback. Like we're making right now, never been. He hollowed out our middle class including our black middle class with open borders, trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages."
"Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up 2014. And the fake news as we wanted to remember the picture of a cage a cage for children, remember the picture of the cage and they said President Trump and then they realized that was in a newspaper 20, 14, the same built by Obama and Biden. The cages and they don't want to report the way it is, they know the way it is, they're not stupid."
They sent young boys to fight in Iraq. The inner cities crumble help the big banks while hammering community leaders and make our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd. That shouldn't happen.
"It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We won't work too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually. But in a very sinister way, virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in forty seven years."
"Racial justice begins with Joe Biden. Retirement from public life, we are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends Senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford please stand up. Two very respected."
"I will tell you two very respected people in Washington, they're respected by everybody. They do some job and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this, jim is running on November 3rd. Jim Inhofe, he's running on November 3rd, I don't even know. James, does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running?"
"I guess there's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James's support. He's got my support. I give him one hundred percent endorsement, jim, Jimmy, I give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you, Jim. Great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is also here is a man who is respected by so many."
"He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by Amanda. I've gotten to know he's done an incredible job with covered and with everything else, he touches governor Kevin step."
"Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Parnell adds that. Thanks, Matt and Representatives, Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Mark. Wayne Mullin is you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him in Jim Jordan in a match together."
"I want Kevin Hearn. Great job today. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan, Alis, Stephan and Lee Zeldin, tom Emmer, Tom you, these are warriors folks is a great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the house."
"These people are incredible David, cuts off David, a great friend of mine, Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job. Debbie? A job and a man who's got very good genes, gREG PANTS, Thank you all. Great job, great. They are. They're warriors, I'll tell you what not every person is. But this group is -- and we have a lot of them in Washington and we'll send Jim Inhofe back and we'll send all of them."
"You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible talented, tough, strong people that love you state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world and then we say not only the world but actually in the history of the world, the men never even challenge me. So I guess I'm right, we did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had."
"The best employment numbers, African-American, Hispanic, American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in his -- we were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me Presidents, Prime Ministers, kings queens and dictators. Dictators would even come in and say congratulations on the economy and then the plague came in. And now what we're doing is we're doing it again and it's going fast."
"We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. It's -- we're doing record business, it's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country."
"So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up, we're going up, we're going up, we're going to go up there."
"We're going to hit October, we're going to be up, we're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped. Where it originated, which was China, but we're going to go up up, up up. August, September, October and people are going to say man, this guy's doing a good job."
"He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore and you're not going to want to lose your -- for one case and you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate, wealth or any wealth. You can think because it will come tumbling down, if these people are put in charge and if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it'll be a whole different ballgame."
"So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we can have a good third quarter. But next year and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had. okay. And if you see that happening, if you see it happening?"
"On November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You even you -- you don't have the guts to vote against Trump, say wait a minute darlin my for one case higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance. You're not gonna want to do that. The stock market has been the best think of this go back one week and go back 50 days in that 50 day period."
"It's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market people and your wife or your husband says Darling. I love you so much. You are such a great investor and all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first sign right. Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser, you've always lost money, but now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial mind."
"Not country at all you did was keep your stuff now you think you're going to run again. So they're going to -- they're gone crazy day. They want the stock market to go down even if it costs them money. They want the stock market to go down even if it costs some money and they don't even know why. You know what, they're smart and they're vicious, but they don't know why I'm telling you they don't know why, what's wrong with having the strongest military brand new in the world, all been what's wrong with having these great economic numbers, what's wrong with having to close it Down we saved millions of lives, you know, a lot of people say we should have got heard."
"Let's go ahead ask them how are they doing in Brazil? He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden right too much has come, how they do it. In Sweden, we saved millions of lives and now it's time to open up, get back to work okay. Get back. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities."
"We slash regulations and pass massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great Senator, also friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina to create opportunity zones which are doing incredibly and since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government."
"Investment have poured into 9000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000 never happened before. TIM SCOTT Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior, David Byrne to place the John Hope, Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network."
"So many of my friends have been asking me so many of my friends including these great politicians. So we're going to do that, it'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice and crime."
"In major city, public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. I think the numbers are worse than that, but Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter public, private religious or independent schools of their choice pro choice, pro choice, pro choice."
"These schools, it's very popular, but some people. It's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong, republicans believe access to education is a civil, right, it's a civil right, twenty of 20 of the most dangerous cities in. Are controlled by Democrats, think of that 20 of 20 And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30 percent."
"They're controlled by Democrats, we can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala or even Afghanistan, how they doing the Democrats running those cities. Your whole country will be like that in 2018 alone are police arrested nearly 12000 people for murder and manslaughter."
"25,000 people for rape and nearly one point 5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats push against sharp police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe thousands of innocent lives will be. Just as President I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement, a vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families and stronger communities for all Americans."
There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years with your help. We will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening. That's what's happening and that was happening. A level that nobody ever thought they'd see it was happening before this Corvette came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible and then China sent us the plague.
"Thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors and will always protect patients with pre existing conditions. Always always we will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities, we will finish the war, which has now two hundred and twelve miles built and beautiful two hundred and twelve mile."
"A lot of miles and let me tell you, I think that was an easy one now is a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened. They realized it was a bad issue for them because they -- these open borders, I love, I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people."
"So did you notice in the end it was like Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone, I said thank you very much and we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair safe, sane and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers First, we will revitalize our cities and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels and airports all across our land."
"We will enact new trade deals. That result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA So made in the USA, It's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states we have car plants coming in would never come. If I wasn't, President would have never come."
"We will become the world's Premier pharmacy, drugstore and medical manufacture that's already started. We're bringing in. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. You know when I took over ISIS was all over the place and I. Something that I felt we should do and we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100 percent of the ISIS caliphate 100 and like our depleted military when I took over like our empty shelves, medically when I took over like all of the things that When I took over, it was a mess."
"We have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. They came in smaller, smaller as well, sir. We've just taken one hundred percent. We will launch a new age of American ambition in space and the United States will be the first station to land on Mars."
"Good brother. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious, liberty and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms interesting how all of a sudden people understand that, right?"
"You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it the right to keep and bear arms. We'll protect your Second Amendment above all. We will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America we will support, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal."
"Justice under the law, we believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history and always salute our great American flag and we live by the words of our national motto."
"It will never change in God We Trust. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who cross the oceans blazed the trail, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal laid down. The railroads. Revolutionized industries won two World Wars defeated fascism and communism and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world and we are making it greater and greater every single day."
"Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people with your help, your devotion and your drive. We are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning."
"We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God america will soon be thriving like never before because ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come together. We will make America wealthy again. We will make America stronger again. We will make America proud again, we will make America safe again."
"And we will make America Great Again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you."
"Thank you very much. Thank you. [Audience chants ""USA""]"
Thank you very much. Go ahead. Sit down. We'll be here for a little while. Sit down.
"Thank you also, Lee Greenwood. Thank you to Lee Greenwood."
"But I'm thrilled to be in Arizona with thousands of patriotic, young Americans who stand up tall for America and refuse to kneel to the radical left. [Applause] That's true. That's true."
"There is something going on. You feel it, right? You feel the spirit?"
"You know, the other night, a speech I made on Saturday night in a very good place, and we had a great evening and the ratings came out -- you saw that -- on television. It was the number one show in Fox history for a Saturday night. [Applause] Unbelievable. Ratings. For them, it's all about the ratings. I know that the other folks back there -- CNN and MSDNC -- [Audience Boos]"
"I know they're very happy. No, no, they're very happy to see that Fox had the number one show. This is the number one show in the history of Fox News. That's pretty good. Saturday night."
"Let us also show our appreciation to my good friend, Charlie. I'll tell you, Charlie is some piece of work -- [applause] -- who is mobilizing a new generation of pro-American student activists. That's what you are, and really smart. And you'll be up here someday. Somebody in that audience, maybe a few of you, you're going to be up here, right here -- who are tough and smart and determined and truly unstoppable. You are."
"I want to thank also Kimberly, and I want to thank my son -- boy, I watched my son. I got here -- wow. I said, ""What's this all about?"" He's good. And people like him. People like him a lot."
"To everyone here today, and watching live all across our country, thank you for bravely defending our nation, our values, and our great American heroes. [Applause]"
"You know what's going on because you're on the frontlines of a tremendous intellectual struggle for the future of our country. It's really what you're talking about -- the future of our country. You see what's happening. It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace. If we weren't here, you could forget it. Okay? But we're going to be here, and then you're going to be here, and we're going to keep it going for a long time. [Applause]"
"November 3rd is a big day. Get out. Get the parents, get the friends, get the husband, get the wife, get everybody."
"Now, the difference is they get everybody, even if they're not registered -- [laughter] -- if they're not citizens, if they're here illegally. They get everybody. That's one of the little difficulties. And, you know, you go through a whole nation and you see what's going on, and they report ""zero illegality."" Check out California sometime. [Laughter] Check out -- no, check out the deal that they signed with Judicial Watch. It was -- I think Judicial Watch was like 1 million or 1.5 million people. They settled. They agreed that that many people either voted illegally, shouldn't have been voting -- a lot of things. They settled. And Judicial Watch said, ""Look, we were so high. What difference did it make? What difference did it make?"" No. Well, they play a very dirty game."
"You're fighting against an oppressive left-wing ideology that is driven by hate and seeks to purge all dissent. And you understand that. Amazing at that age. You're young people, generally. A couple of oldsters out there -- friends of mine."
"The radical left demands absolute conformity from every professor, researcher, reporter, journalist, corporation, entertainer, politician, campus speaker, and private citizen. But we have Charlie, and we have our people, and our people are stronger. [Applause]"
"Our people are stronger, and our people are smarter, and we are the elite. We are the elite. [Applause] You know, do you ever notice? They said it two weeks ago. I was talking to somebody who says, ""Well, you know the elite... "" I said, ""What are you talking about, the elite? Who's the elite? They're the elite?"" They're not the elite. You're the elite. You are. [Applause] You're smarter, better looking. You have a better future. You know your way around better, believe it or not."
There's only one thing they have: They're more vicious. They are vicious. They are vicious people.
"Anyone who dissents from their orthodoxy must be punished, canceled, or banished. That includes from television. You see it. But you will not be silenced. And, you know, the bottom line -- I get interviewed by people, and I'm sitting the other day in the Oval Office, and I didn't like the tone. And I said, ""You know, it's really nice because I'm here and you're not."" [Laughter and applause] The Oval Office."
"And I've said it before: You're the courageous warriors standing in the way of what they want to do and their goals, and standing up for faith and family, God, country, and freedom. Freedom. [Applause] Right? [Audience chants ""USA""]"
"Unbelievable spirit. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. But the radical left, they hate our history, they hate our values, and they hate everything we prize as Americans. And we're right, because our country didn't grow great with them; it grew great with you and your thought process and your ideology. [Applause]"
"The left-wing mob is trying to demolish our heritage so they can replace it with a new repressive regime that they alone control. They're tearing down statues, desecrating monuments, and purging dissenters. It's not the behavior of a peaceful political movement; it's the behavior of totalitarians and tyrants and people that don't love our country. They don't love our country."
"The left is not trying to promote justice or equality or lift up the downtrodden. They have one goal: The pursuit of their own political power, for whatever reason. But that's their goal. That really seems to be their goal -- their goal or their sickness. [Audience Boos]"
"And if you give power to people that demolish monuments and attack churches and seize city streets and set fire to buildings, then nothing is sacred and no one is safe. We stopped them last night. Did you see that? Andrew Jackson. [Applause] And brought some to jail and others are going to jail. [Applause]"
"The problem we have is: States -- they're weak. They're weak. The -- many of the governors, many of the mayors. You see what's going on. And it's -- by the way, just so you understand, it's all liberal Democrat states. Could you imagine if Sleepy Joe ever became President? This country would be a mess. If ever became President, this country would be a mess. They would rip down everything.  [Audience Boos]"
"Everything. Sleepy Joe. And he's -- he wouldn't call the shots, belie- -- he would have nothing to do with it. ""Lock him in the Oval Office. Let's just do what we want to do."" [Laughter]"
"That's why -- and, you know, today he's with Obama -- President Obama. It only took him -- how long? -- a year and a half to endorse him. What did it take? A year and a half to endorse him? Even after he won, he didn't endorse him for a long time. [Laughter]"
"And he's fighting -- he's fighting for Sleepy Joe. You know, he really feels strongly about it, so strongly that he was fighting. He wanted everybody to win but Joe. Joe won. [Laughter]"
"But if you remember, in my campaign, he fought harder than Crooked Hillary. President Obama fought me harder. He said, ""You cannot let him win. You cannot this... "" He was all over the place. I said, ""This guy is spending all of his time campaigning against me."" Uh, who won? That's right. [Applause]"
"And don't forget -- don't forget, I'm only here because of him and Biden. I'm only here because of them. Because if they did a good job, we wouldn't have been here. There would've been no reason. So I'm only here because of President Obama and the job he did, and Sleepy Joe Biden and the job that he didn't do, other than he did a good job for his son. Did a good job for his son."
"No, but I'm only here because of them; otherwise, I wouldn't be here. People were very unhappy. The fake news doesn't report it. They were very unhappy. There was tremendous dissent, tremendous anger -- a lot of people in this audience, I can tell you."
"But we're here today to declare that we will never cave to the left wing and the left-wing intolerance. [Applause] We will never -- we will never surrender to mob violence, and we will uphold American freedom, equality, and justice for every citizen of every background, very strong."
That's who we are. That is what we believe. And that is why we must prevail on November 3rd. We have to prevail. Get out there. [Applause]
"So we're honored to be joined by a great gentleman, a great governor of this state. He won by a lot of votes. And I said to him, ""Governor, how am I doing? He said, ""You're doing really well."" I said, ""Good,"" because he knows better than anybody. He really has done a tremendous job as governor. Arizona Governor, Doug Ducey. Where is Doug? [Applause] Thank you, Doug. Thank you."
"And somebody who we need to keep in the Senate, a woman who works very hard -- I just got back from something you like: the border wall -- Martha McSally. [Applause] Martha, please. Please. Thank you, Martha. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Martha. We got to get her in. And Mark Kelly, who she's running against, is very weak on China and lots of others things.  [Audience Boos]"
"If -- between Biden and Kelly and these people -- they get in, China will own this country. And they don't own us at all. We have -- we have done great, before the plague set in, before the plague came over. Right? It came over."
"We were doing the greatest -- we had the greatest economy we ever had, the greatest job numbers we ever had, the greatest of everything. There wasn't a thing where we weren't number one. We were beating them and they were having a tough year. Sixty-seven. It was one of the worst years they had in 67 years. And we were doing great. And then they said there's a plague coming over from China. Here it comes. [Laughter] What a disgrace. What a disgrace. And now you saw, last week, the jobs numbers, the biggest ever. You saw the retail sales numbers, the biggest ever. Number one. [Applause]"
"And we're going to have a very good third quarter. And interesting, we're going to have good third quarter. And right when those numbers are announced, you have your election. So that's hopefully a sign from up there. But I think we're going to do very well. And they are trying to do their best to keep the country shut down and closed, because they'd love those numbers not to be good. But there's not a lot they're going to be able to do about it. Not a lot."
"But we want to get Martha in. And we want to -- I want to thank Martha for being here. Governor, I want to thank you for being here. I want to thank you for being such a great friend, too. Thank you. [Applause]"
"And we also have some of your warriors, great representatives, and they fought with me on the impeachment hoax -- one of the great hoaxes, based on a telephone conversation that was perfect. I'm the only one that got impeached in history -- hopefully will be the only one -- that got impeached over a perfect telephone call. Like, perfect. Perfect. This was, like, the perfect call. I said, ""Wait a minute."" I said, ""We don't need lawyers. Just keep reading... "" -- thank goodness we had it transcribed. It was very good that we had it, because remember Adam Schiff got up and he made up a phony story. He made up a phony story.  [Audience Boos]"
It's what they're all about. I said it before: They're vicious.
"Paul Gosar. Stand up. Paul. Where's Paul? [Applause] Paul. Stand up, Paul. [Applause] Paul. Great guy. Here's a man -- I spoke to him this morning -- Andy Biggs. Andy. [Applause] Great guy. Thank you, Andy. Freedom Caucus. Now that Mark Meadows is our great chief -- he's our chief. Mark Meadows. By the way, Mark Meadows is here too. Let's have it for Mark Meadows. Where's Mark? Mark Meadows. [Applause]"
"But Andy took over, and the Freedom Caucus is doing great. Thank you. Thank you, Andy."
"Somebody I got to know very well during the hoax: Debbie Lesko. [Applause] She's great. That's another one. Oh, there she is. She just stood out on television and it was like she popped. She did great. I said, ""You're so lucky you know me, Debbie."" [Laughter] Because she really was one of the people -- she stood out. Thank you, Deb. Thank you. [Applause]"
"Another warrior: David Schweikert. David, thank you. Thank you, David. [Applause] Thank you."
"And a man who is very understated -- he just gets it done behind the scenes, never likes to go on television, never likes talking a lot, but he's a great congressman from one of my favorite states, Florida: Matt Gaetz. [Applause] Matt Gaetz. Where is he? Matt Gaetz. [Applause] He keeps it low-key and simple, right? No, actually, he keeps it up and not simple. [Laughter] But he's great, and he does a fantastic job. Thank you, Matt."
"Along with a lot of great people: Arizona Treasurer, Kimberly Yee. [Applause] Kimberly, thank you. House Speaker Rusty Bowers. Rusty. Rusty. Thank you, Rusty. Thank you. Senate President -- wow, that's a big deal -- Karen Fann. [Applause] Thank you."
"So, Madam President, how am I doing in Arizona? Okay? She says yes. She knows. She knows. [Laughs]"
And Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizer. Thank you. [Applause]
"I also want to recognize a truly courageous woman, Angel Mom -- she's a friend of mine too, by the way. One of the first people I met when I announced I was going to run. What she has gone through with illegal immigration, nobody will ever go through. Hopefully nobody ever has to go through. Unfortunately, people will have to do it. But she is one of the first people I met. And she lost a magnificent child to an illegal immigrant. And it's just a horrible thing. And she spent her life -- she spent the last long period of years fighting and fighting and fighting. And people have gotten to respect her greatly: Mary Ann Mendoza, wherever you might be. [Applause] A lot of guts. She's got a lot of guts."
"And thank you -- a very special thank you to Pastor Luke Barnett -- [applause] -- and the Dream City Church for hosting us. Where is the pastor? Pastor? Is that the pastor? He's good looking. Where is the pastor? Where -- I want to see this guy. Oh, he's good. [Applause] I'll be here. I'll get here someday. I'll be here some Sunday morning. Thank you. [Applause] Thank you very much. Great job, Pastor. I hear -- I hear great things. Thank you very much."
"We're also joined by a man who became such a superstar overnight. You know, I put him there as a little bit of a filler, to be honest. [Laughter] He did a great job. He was the ambassador to Germany, right? And he was like -- you know, I needed somebody to sit and warm out a chair. [Laughter] He wore out the chair. He didn't warm it; he wore it out. Right, Matt Gaetz? He wore out the chair. Richard Grenell. [Applause] Where is Richard? [Applause] What a guy. Where's Matt? No? Say hello. You are fantastic."
"Oh, the picture of him walking into the DOJ with a big satchel. And I realized what good shape he's in. He goes -- and he's walking. [Laughter] And those guys -- and he had lots of gold -- gold in those satchels, didn't he? Huh? [Laughter] Because I'll tell you, we caught them. Let's see what happens, but we caught them. [Applause] Right? We caught them."
"And a friend of mine that did a great job as the NASA CFO -- and you see we've totally rebuilt NASA. We're sending rockets up now for the first time in many years. [Applause] Jeff DeWit. Jeff DeWit. [Applause] Jeff, hi. Thank you, Jeff."
Everyone in this room is bound together by a shared set of moral principles and enduring truths. We believe the United States of America is the greatest and most righteous nation that has ever existed. We're going to keep it that way. [Applause]
"We believe that every citizen has the fundamental right to think, to speak, to live and pray according to their own conscience."
"We believe that the beloved heroes of American history should not be torn down by militant mobs, but held up as an example to the world. [Applause] Now they're after George Washington. I said, ""What did he do wrong?"" George Washington. [Laughter] Thomas Jefferson. We stopped them. They were heading toward the Jefferson Memorial. They have -- they couldn't care less. I think half of them don't even know who Thomas Jefferson is. [Laughter]"
"How about Ulysses S. Grant? They want the Confederate soldiers. But all of a sudden, they go after Grant. But he's the one that defeated the Confederate soldiers. So what's that all about?"
"How about Gandhi? How about Churchill? You know, Churchill -- because this is going outside of our country now."
"No, we'll stop it. Don't worry. Just don't worry about it. Ten years is a long time to spend in prison. [Applause]"
"So our heroes are not a source of shame. They are an example and something that you can all look up to -- a true example of greatness, a point of pride. And we will honor them and cherish them forever. We will cherish them."
"And we have to cherish our past. We have to cherish good or bad. We have to understand our past. We have to understand our history. Because if we don't know our history, it could all happen again. We have to know our history. [Applause]"
"We believe in law and order, we support the men and women of law enforcement -- [applause] -- and we stand with the citizens in every city and every community and every part of our country who wish to live in safety, security, dignity, and peace. [Applause]"
"And we know that American patriots don't bow down to foreign powers, we don't back down from left-wing bullies, and the only authority we worship is our God. [Applause]"
"These are the values our country was built upon, these are the values that unite our citizens, and these are the values that powered our civilization to its towering heights, lifting billions from poverty, healing disease, curing illness, and reaching new summits of scientific endeavor, artistic triumph, and human achievement."
"Guided by these timeless convictions, my administration has been delivering historic gains for the American people -- [applause] -- like no one has ever done in the first three and a half years of a presidency. Not even close. It's not even close."
"By the end of my first term, we will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved. [Applause] Three hundred. If you get 10, it's a lot. Three hundred. An all-time record. And very importantly, we confirmed two great Supreme Court justices. [Applause]"
"And we have to win because obviously we need more justices on the Supreme Court. [Applause] People don't realize how important that is. I've always heard it's the most important thing you can do. I always said defense, but that's right there: Supreme Court justices and judges. And we are setting records."
We spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the awesome power of the United States military. [Applause] And I very proudly created the sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces: the Space Force. [Applause] Big deal. That's a big deal. That's a big deal.
"You think just that -- if you did just that, that's like, ""Oh, that's a good presidency."" Think of that. That's one of many, many things -- we'll go over a few of them -- but many, many things."
"So the Air Force was the last one. That was 75 years ago. The Air Force -- 75 years ago. We just created another branch. We're going to have a general -- a nice general -- we have right now, on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for full -- full deal. And that's a great honor because space is going to be very important. At first, they smiled when I came up with the idea. I never talked about it in the campaign. I don't think I ever mentioned it once. It's just an idea that I learned as I was going through military. And, really, an amazing thing. Space is going to be so important. That'll be one of our most important of all. And it's an honor."
"We're now doing a hydrosonic [sic] -- I call them ""super dupers"" -- missile. [Laughter] It goes 17 times faster than the fastest missile right now. Seventeen times. [Applause]"
"We passed VA Choice -- a big deal -- and VA Accountability, a big deal. They've been trying for 50 years -- almost 50 years on both. Accountability, they couldn't fire people that treated our vets badly. Now we can say, ""You're fired."""
"Oh, by the way, you had a big deal. [Applause] That's right. That's right. You had a big deal in Arizona. I've been reading about it for years now, Doug, where they had somebody stealing in the VA. And they caught them cold. Like $500,000, right? That's a lot. They stole $500,000, and they couldn't fire him. They couldn't fire him. So between the unions and civil service and all the things, they couldn't fire him. But we made it so that you can now say, ""You're fired. Get out."" [Applause] That's right."
"And they'll give our veterans the care they so richly deserve. You know, Choice is so big. Instead of waiting for a week, two weeks, five weeks -- you have no idea how bad it was -- if they have to wait -- and they have great doctors; we have great doctors in the VA. If you have to wait -- if, for any reason, there's a delay, you go outside, you get a doctor, you get fixed up, we pay the bill."
"And it sounds expensive. It's cheap. It's cheap. We save money. Most importantly, we save lives. People would get on line and they're okay -- not feeling well. By the time they see a doctor -- in some cases, it's terminally -- they -- they are terminally ill. It would take weeks and weeks. And now we have VA Choice, and that's why you see good stories. Ninety-one percent approval rating. Okay? [Applause] Ninety-one percent approval rating. VA. VA Choice. Nobody thought we were going to get that one done."
"We passed the largest package of tax cuts and tax reforms, and we passed the largest number of regulation cuts, by a factor of many times. No other administration -- even though, in some cases, eight years, and in one case, more -- nobody has cut regulation like we've cut regulation. Not even close. [Applause] And it's one of the reasons we did so well before the plague and we're doing so well after the plague. It's going away."
"We eliminated Obamacare's unfair individual mandate -- [applause] -- which punished young Americans, like you, for the privilege of not buying bad health insurance. That's really what it was. You had the privilege of not buying, and you had to pay for it. Not too good, so we got rid of it. That was a big deal. That was one of the most unpopular things anywhere, on any subject."
"We will always protect people with preexisting conditions. [Applause] And you have Martha's pledge that she is going to do that also. [Applause] So, we're going to do that. And the Democrats can't make that pledge because they're going to raise your taxes like crazy. I never heard -- you know, all my life --  [Audience Boos]"
"-- I think Doug can maybe explain it. But, Doug, all my life, I'd watch. And the best politicians, they wanted to cut taxes, not raise taxes. All of a sudden, we're in an age where things are very different -- let's face it -- ripping down statues."
"One of the things is the Democrats want to raise your taxes to a level that nobody can even believe. And it won't be nearly enough to pay for what they want to do. You talk about bad healthcare; it's just going to be a disaster. But they want to raise everybody's taxes. I always thought it was supposed to be the other way, right? But let's see how they do on November 3rd. I don't think they're going to do too well. [Applause]"
"We passed Right to Try to give critically ill patients access to lifesaving cures, so they don't have to travel all around the world and see if they can find. And we've had tremendous success with that. Right to Try. I'm very proud of it. They've been trying to get that one done for 40 years, too. [Applause]"
"And I've just come from the Arizona border, Yuma -- [applause] -- where we marked the completion of over 220 miles of brand-new, beautiful border wall. [Applause, Audience chants ""Build that wall""]"
"You know, you don't hear about the wall. They don't want to talk about the wall anymore. Do you notice? Never has the Democrat Party fought so hard against something. And do you notice? They never talk about the wall. Because, in the end, they gave it up. They gave up. We won. We're building it. Fully funded. [Applause]"
"I could build numerous walls with all of the money I have. Fully funded. [Laughter] But do you know why they don't talk about it? Because it's a bad subject. Remember? They used to say, ""It's obsolete. We want drones."" Oh great, the drone is flying around. We're going to watch everyone pour into our country with a drone. [Laughter]"
"Remember? They said, ""The wall is obsolete."" And I said today -- nobody heard it. I thought it was sort of -- I think -- I said it, but I'm sure people have said it over the years. You know, you're in an industry; in many cases, you have a computer. In about two weeks, it's old. It's obsolete, right? In technology -- I said to some of the people -- I meet them all. I say, ""The problem with your business, it gets obsolete quick."" Two things that will never be obsolete: a wheel and a wall. Right? [Laughter and applause] A wheel and a wall."
"And they'd say, ""That wall is obsolete. With modern technology... "" No, no, modern technology is like, ""Let's watch everybody pour in."" No, we have a wall."
"So, we built 220 miles. We're going to have -- and it's every single element. I met with Border Patrol, who are fantastic, by the way. Every single element they wanted. You have to see through, which makes sense. You have to do all of the different -- we have cameras on it. We have sensors on it. It is just great. Thirty feet high. It's very hard. Very hard. [Applause] We have anti-climb provision on the top. We have the whole deal, and it's very powerful. And, by the way, where that wall is, nobody is getting through. Nobody gets through. [Applause]"
"We put a chunk -- California -- off the record, California was saying, ""Please, can we have the wall?"" This is California. You know, they didn't want the wall. They didn't want the wall. But they wanted the wall, right? Because right next to San Diego is a wonderful town in Mexico. You know the town; I won't mention the name. [Laughter] But they're heavily infected with COVID."
"Do you ever notice? I said, the other night -- did anybody see my speech the other night, on Saturday night? [Applause] But I said the other night, ""There's never been anything where they have so many names."" I could give you 19 or 20 names for that, right? It's got all different names. ""Wuhan."" ""Wuhan"" was catching on. ""Coronavirus,"" right? [Audience member shouts ""Kung Flu""]"
"Kung flu, yeah. [Applause] Kung flu. ""COVID."" ""COVID-19."" ""COVID."" I said, ""What's the '19'?"" ""COVID-19."" Some people can't explain what the 19 -- give me the -- ""COVID-19."" I said, ""That's an odd name."" I could give you many, many names."
"Some people call it the ""Chinese flu,"" the ""China flu."" Right? They call it the ""China,"" as opposed to ""Chi-"" -- the ""China."" I've never seen anything like it."
"But here's the story: We are going to be stronger than ever before, and it's going to be soon. [Applause]"
"And I think you'll remember -- you know, now Biden is going around like he's a tough guy. You know, he doesn't know where the hell he is. Where -- where are you, Joe? Joe? Where are you, Joe? Tell me where you are, Joe. [Laughter]"
"But he's going around, ""I stood up for China."" No, his son walked out with $1.5 billion to manage. [Audience members calls out ""Where's Hunter?""]"
"And what he did -- where is Hunter? Remember, I said, ""Where is Hunter?"" They came out with a T-shirt, and some guy made a fortune. ""Where's Hunter?"" [Applause] By the way, where is Hunter?"
"Man, he did well as Vice President. Could you imagine how Hunter is going to do if this guy ever won? [Laughter] And the father could honestly say, ""I have no idea what's going on."" [Laughter] You know, he could raise his hand --"
"So, Kayleigh -- where is Kayleigh? Where is Kayleigh? Where is Kayleigh? Where is our Kayleigh? What a job she's done -- our Press Secretary. [Applause] Where is she? [Applause]"
"Everyone is doing well. Our Press Secretary -- [inaudible] Press Secretary. I mean, Sarah is going to be the governor of Arkansas pretty soon, I hope. [Applause] Sean has got his own show. And this one here, she could run whatever the hell she wanted. But I said, ""Don't run. Don't run. Just stay here. We like the job you're doing."" No, we're doing great."
"I stood up to China like no other administration in history. For decades, they've ripped us off. They ripped us off like nobody -- [Audience members calls out, inaudible]"
"And I charged them a little thing called ""massive tariffs."" [Laughter] We took in billions and billions of dollars. They devalued their currency. And, you know, they like to say our people paid. No, no, no. Our people didn't pay. They devalued their currency in order to pay it, and they also put money out there -- otherwise they wouldn't have been able to sell their product."
"But what happened for many years -- there is nobody ever that ripped off the United States like China. Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. [Audience member shouts ""Thank you""]"
"So now we did a deal, but, you know, the ink wasn't dry when the -- when the plague flew in. The ink wasn't dry. The deal was great. Everybody was happy. I was thrilled. Two hundred and fifty billion dollars' worth of purchases over a short period of time. All great. But the ink wasn't dry, and we got hit by the plague, so I'm not too happy about that."
"But the long, slow surrender is over because, today and every day, we are putting now America first. America comes first. [Applause]"
"We sparked a revolution in domestic energy production, and the United States is now the number-one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on planet Earth. [Applause]"
"America, as of a couple of years ago, is no longer energy dependent; we are now energy dominant. [Applause] And because our energy use went down so much during this pandemic -- it was a very, very bad period of time because we have 10 million jobs -- energy jobs. And now we have the oil price up where it should be, and yet people are paying very little for gasoline. That's like the perfect thing, right? That's the perfect thing to do. [Applause]"
"And I signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform, which nobody was able to get done. Very important. [Applause] Very important. Very important."
I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. Nobody knows that. [Applause]
"And we created Opportunity Zones, along with Tim Scott. And since then, countless jobs and one hundred billion dollars of new investment have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods in the country -- 9,000. Opportunity Zones."
"So think of it: I did criminal justice reform. We did a lot of work on prison -- on prison reform. We did Opportunity Zones. Think of this. Think of all we've done. And we've taken care of the black colleges and universities. And nobody talks about it, but I have to talk about it. And you know what? [Applause] Our black communities know it. And I think you're going to see something really great happen because they understand it. They really understand it."
"And I'll tell you what: Whether it's any community you talk about -- but if you take a look at those numbers from pre-virus -- but you take a look at them in a year from now, you watch. And your 401s right now -- your 401(k)s -- I don't think you want to have somebody else playing with them because you're just about at a record high. And you put the wrong person in, they will be obliterated. They will be obliterated."
"So we're fighting for school choice because we know that access to education is a civil right. [Applause] It's a civil right. School choice. Did you ever see two parties so diametrically opposed to each other? I mean, it's -- who can be opposed to that? But it's so important. But the Democrats will never ever allow that to happen."
"Last month, we returned American astronauts to space aboard American rockets -- [applause] -- for the first time in nearly a decade. And the United States will be the first nation to plant our beautiful American flag on planet Mars. [Applause]"
"And we destroyed -- we destroyed 100 percent of the ISIS territorial caliphate. [Applause] And the savage terrorist monsters, al-Baghdadi and Qasem Soleimani, they are both dead. [Applause] A hundred percent. A hundred percent of the ISIS caliphate. And when I took over, that caliphate was gone like this. It was a mess, but we destroyed it."
"No administration has accomplished more in just three and a half years. It is -- I mean, I could go after -- those are just a few points. I could talk for an hour and a half just reading the points off. You know that."
"Yet, as you know, in recent months, America has faced down that unseen enemy: the virus from the distant land that spread across the globe and invaded our shores, but invaded the shores of -- think of it -- 88 -- 188 nations. I have a friend -- he's a very smart guy -- he said, ""I didn't know there were that many nations."" [Laughter] I said, ""Actually, go over 200."" But 188 nations -- [Audience member calls out ""We love you""]"
"-- that we know of. I love you, too. Thank you, darling. [Applause] Thank you."
"And tomorrow, the fake news will be said, ""He said he loves somebody."" [Laughter] ""He said he loves somebody."" Terrible. of brand-new, beautiful border wall. [Applause]"
"Terrible. I'll be in big trouble -- the fake news. They are terrible people. Who are the two -- who are the people that stood up? I just want to -- stand up, please. Who said, ""I love you""? That's -- whoa! [Applause]"
"Sit down fast, please. Don't -- don't let them see you. That's a lot of press back there. Look at that. That's the problem: They cover all these speeches. You know, I never have a speech done -- I never have the speech were it's not like live television."
"You know, sometimes you'll have one where you can actually speak, and you don't have to worry about, like, one little slip -- one tiny, little slip. One word. You could say 10 speeches. One little word, they'll say, ""He's lost it."" [Laughter] No."
You know who's lost it? Sleepy Joe has lost it. Sleepy Joe. [Applause]
"In response, we took swift and early action to ban travel from China very, very early. Remember Nancy Pelosi and that crazy group? of brand-new, beautiful border wall. [Applause]"
"Nancy Pelosi. She wanted to dance in the streets of Chinatown in San Francisco, long after I banned China from coming here. We saved tens of thousands of lives with that early decision, and then we made an early decision on Europe."
"Yet liberal lawmakers and Democrat politicians condemned this policy. The left rejected science in favor of their fanatical devotion to open borders. They want open borders, not just our southern border. of brand-new, beautiful border wall. [Applause]"
"This is why the left is so dangerous. They always put their ideology before your safety. It's crazy what's going on. Defund and abolish the police -- how is that? A good idea? of brand-new, beautiful border wall. [Applause]"
"You know, I passed a set -- I was in the White House, and there was this set, and it had, ""Dems say"" -- think of it -- ""defund and abolish."" I said, ""What are they going to defund?"" [Audience member calls out, inaudible]"
"No, I said -- it says ""defund and abolish."" I said, ""What? What are they going to defund and abolish?"" I thought it was going to be something. They said, ""The police."" I said, ""Oh, great. I just won the election. That's great."" [Applause, Laughter] ""Defund and abolish."" [Audience chants ""Four more years""]"
"So, in addition to issuing a series of aggressive travel bans, my administration launched the greatest national mobilization since World War Two. We have done such a great job with this, between the ventilators and all of these things, including testing. We're testing so much, we're now up to 27.5 million tests. I thought it was 25 because it seemed like 25 million. Twenty-seven -- they just told me, 27.5 million test."
"Now, when you have all those tests, you have more cases. So the news covers it: ""They have more cases."" Well, yeah, if you're going to do 20 -- and if, let's say, other countries do 1 million, 2 million -- big countries -- 3 million --"
"Now, four weeks ago, Germany was at 3 million tests. So I don't know what they are now, but I know they're not anywhere near where we are."
"So then they'll say, ""We have more cases."" Now, look, we want to do testing. We want to do everything, but they use it to make us look bad. But because of it, our mortality rate is so low. It's so great what's happened. So we want to test. [Applause]"
"So we do all these tests, and we find pockets, and we find people, and we find cases. And they say, ""The cases have jumped,"" instead of saying what a job we're doing with testing. But we did the job with testing. And we did ventilators, and we did -- we came up with tests that nobody has -- we have so many different types of tests. We have the five-minute test, the ten-minute test. We have tests -- you send them to a public lab, a private lab. We have tests -- it's a lot of tests. [Laughter] And other countries that have done very well with testing, they call us. They say, ""There's nobody that's been able to do the job with -- that you've done."""
"Now, the only ones that can't get to say that are the fake news media people. They can't say it. [Audience boos]"
"Someday, it'll be recognized by history. Someday. But our actions and your selfless sacrifice -- and that's what it was -- saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We had to do it. And we did the right thing. And I'll tell you what, we did the right thing. Now we open. We got to get it open because -- you know, I said, ""We got to get it open. People need it."""
You know people get sick from the other also. It's not just from the virus. They get sick from all of the other things that happen. You know what I mean. [Applause]
"We cut through red tape to accelerate breakthrough therapies and vaccines. We're going to have a vaccine very soon. [Applause] We distributed 1.5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment. We unleashed the medical and logistical power of the United States Military. And thanks to our efforts, not a single American who needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator. That's impossible. That's impossible. [Applause]"
"Remember when the New York governor, Governor Cuomo, said he needs 40,000 ventilators? [Audience boos]"
"Our people said, ""No, no, you need 4,000. Maybe 5,000."" Anyway, we got him what we thought was right. They never needed all of them. In fact, they gave some to other people. But he didn't need 40- -- 40,000, as opposed to 4,000 or 5,000. And it worked out great."
"Then he wanted a hospital built in the Javits Convention Center. We built it, but he didn't use it. He could have used it for the older people. It was brand new, not infected. No infection."
"Then he wanted the boat. He wanted the boat to come up. The beautiful, beautiful hospital ship. You know what that is called, right? And it came up. They could have used it for senior citizens. They didn't use it. And it's a shame. It's a shame. It's a shame."
"We're now the chief ventilator producer anywhere in the world. We're helping other countries with ventilators because ventilators are very hard to make. They're very complex. They're big and expensive. And many countries are calling us, asking for help. They need ventilators, and we're able to do it because we're making thousands of ventilators. Think of this: thousands of ventilators a week. [Applause]"
"And to rescue the U.S. economy, which is happening now, we passed over $3 trillion in relief measures. We suspended student loan payments and interest for college students. [Applause]"
"And to protect jobs for young Americans just like you, we took historic action to block the entry of foreign workers into our nation. [Applause] We believe that companies should hire American workers and American students first. They have to hire -- we got to go American. We got to go American. [Applause]"
"You know, we were down to 3.4, 3.5 percent unemployment, and that's one thing. But now we got to get back to those numbers, then we can think -- right? -- then we can think about taking people in through merit. Only through merit. Or mostly through a merit. [Applause] I better say ""mostly,"" because they'll say, ""That's a terrible thing."" [Laughter]"
"You know, you can't make a little bit of a slip. They'll say, ""He said 'only.' What about this? What about that?"" Generally speaking, we like merit, okay? [Laughter and applause]"
"We want American students to fill American jobs. That's the biggest difference between us and the left. We know that our first duty is to take care of our citizens. ""Make America Great Again."" [Applause]"
"So, before the plague came in, we had the best of the everything. We had the best interest rates. We had the best employment rates. We had the best job numbers ever. We had everything. Unemployment for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans had all reached the lowest rates ever recorded in the history of our country. [Applause]"
"It's amazing how many categories -- young people, young people without a high school diploma, young people without a college diploma -- we were number one on every list you can think of."
"Women: 75 years. Not as good. I'm sorry. But it was getting ready to hit the all-time. Women, it was the best in 75 years, so I have to apologize. Can you believe that? We did the best in 75 years, and I apologize to women. But we were ready to hit the all-time, and then we got hit by something that should have never happened because they could have stopped it."
Young people had seen their wages rise by more than 10 percent. They'd never seen anything like that. [Applause]
"We built the strongest and most prosperous economy in the history of the world. And we will do it again very, very quickly. It's happening already. [Applause]"
We've just added two and a half million jobs last month. Think of that. That's the largest increase in the history of our country: two and a half million jobs in one month. [Applause]
"And just to add the topping: As I mentioned, the 18 percent in retail sales -- the surge -- was the biggest jump ever recorded in the history of our country. [Applause]"
"The stock market in the last 50 days is the best stock market in history. And it went up today again, by the way. [Applause] Think of that. Think of that. [Applause] Go back a week -- 50 days, the strongest 50 days in stock market history. This is during, hopefully, the end of the pandemic."
"But as we fight to restore, renew, and rebuild our country, the hard left is trying to divide, denigrate, and destroy our country. The American people have watched in horror as left-wing extremists have looted businesses, violently assaulted innocent civilians, and brutally injured hundreds and hundreds of police officers -- our great police officers. [Audience boos]"
They even vandalized -- that's right -- the Lincoln Memorial. The Lincoln Memorial. [Audience boos]
"The radical left thinks the future belongs to them. No, the future belongs to you. It belongs to people that love our country. [Applause] So we're not going to take moral lectures from the same left-wing ideologues who oppose school choice, who support deadly sanctuary cities, who want to defund our police -- defund and abolish our police. Think of it: Defund and abolish is now their theme. And who preside over the violence and mayhem of the 20 most dangerous cities in America. Twenty for twenty. Twenty most dangerous -- run by Democrats. And it will happen to our country if a guy like Joe Biden gets in. Because Joe Biden has no control over what's happening. They won't even be talking to him."
"The murder rate in Detroit and Baltimore is higher than that of El Salvador, Guatemala, or Afghanistan. But the left launches no protests over these travesties -- they're travesties -- because it doesn't serve their radical agenda. Think of that. Tougher than Afghanistan. All run by Democrats."
"While their movement is based on hate, ours is based on love -- love of our family, love of our nation, and love of our fellow citizens. [Applause]"
"We embrace the noble vision of Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. and believe that people should not be judged based ""on the color of their skin, but the content of their character."" [Applause]"
"This is a choice of two futures: the left's vision of disunity and discord or our vision of equal opportunity and equal justice. Every American should take a long look at the bedlam in Seattle, because that's exactly what will come to every city near you, every suburb and community in America, if the radical-left Democrats are put in charge."
"They want to abolish ICE. Do you have any idea how patriotic ICE people are? I know them. They are very tough. I agree. [Applause] Very tough. They're very tough. I agree. They like to fight. I agree. But you don't want to do it. Look, I'm looking at some pretty tough guys right here. Look. You're not going to do. He's not going into an MS-13 nest, swinging, swinging. No. These guys are tough. They're smart. They're getting them out by the thousands. They're taking MS-13 out of our country by the thousands. [Applause]"
"They want to abolish ICE, get rid of ICE, abolish bail. They want no bail anymore. Just, you know, we put you in for murder. ""It's okay, come back whenever you have a chance."" [Laughter] You see what's going on in some places like Philadelphia -- what's happening in Philadelphia, what's happening in other cities. [Audience member calls out ""Chicago""]"
Look at what's going on in Chicago. What's that all about? Chicago was a great city.
"But they want to abolish borders and abolish every police department in the country. The Democrats are also trying to rig the election by sending out tens of millions of mail-in ballots, using the China virus -- [Audience boos]"
"-- as the excuse for allowing people not to go to the polls. ""Hey, we have a virus coming. We have to send... """
"Think of it: California. He's going to be sending out millions and millions of ballots. Well, where are they going? Where are these ballots going? Who's getting them? Who is not getting them? A little section that's Republican. Will they be stolen from mailboxes as they get put in by the mailman? Will they be taken from the mailmen and the mailwomen? Will they be forged? Who is signing them? Who's signing them? What, are they signed on the kitchen table and sent in? Will they be counterfeited by groups inside our nation? Will they be counterfeited, maybe by the millions, by foreign powers who don't want to see Trump win because nobody has been tougher on trade or making our country great again? Nobody. [Applause]"
"No, mail-in ballots is a disaster for our country. It's going to end up in a big -- you know. Look, just -- just forget about all of this stuff. Forget about speeches and teleprompters and all of that. They send out millions of ballots. Who's getting them? How are they delivered? Who's not getting them? Think of it. It's going to be fraud all over the place. And if you look right now -- if you look right now, look at all of the disputes they're having on mail-in ballots."
"A friend of mine, who's a great guy, had a son who passed away seven years ago. Seven years ago. He came to see me the other day. He said, ""They just sent to my son, Robert, a mail-in ballot. He died seven years ago."" There is no way they can control that."
"With mail-in ballots, you introduce something in the middle of an election year, and you have something where it's very complex -- you have no time to fix this very complex process. It's very complex. This will be, in my opinion, the most corrupt election in the history of our country. And we cannot let this happen. They want it to happen so badly. [Applause]"
"We believe in the sacred principle of one person, one vote. And that's why we are fighting for the integrity of our elections. [Applause] Absentee ballots are fine. Absentee ballots are fine. Like I live in the White House, and if I can't get to Florida, or you live wherever you live, and you can't. But you have to go through a process. Some people just can't make it to a polling station, and they have good reason. But they have good reason. But they have to go through this process in order to verify their identity."
People went to the polls and voted during World War One. They went to the polls and voted during World War Two. We can safely go to the polls and vote during COVID-19. [Applause]
"And there is tremendous evidence of fraud whenever you have mail-in ballots. And, frankly, if we are really going to protect our elections -- and some people don't want to hear this: We must have voter ID. [Applause, Audience chants ""USA""]"
"So, as long as I'm President, America will be a land of fair laws, swift justice, and safe communities. And that's why, when rioting and looting broke out in our nation's capital, I quickly deplored [sic] -- I came in and I deployed the National Guard very quickly. Mark Meadows was there. We had a lot of our people there. [Applause] We stopped the violence. We saved that incredible statue -- you saw it last night -- and restored peace and order to the streets. Although, I will tell you, they did great damage to the cannons that were on the ground. They did great damage, but we'll get them fixed. We'll get them fixed. [Audience chants ""Lock them up""]"
"Lock them up. Yeah. Lock them up. [Applause] It's incredible how they can do it. Incredible. But they did damage. [Audience member calls out ""We love you""]"
"We love you. We just got there in time. You saw the ropes going up? We got there just -- and I'll tell you, law enforcement did a great job. They rushed them. They rushed them. [Applause] And these people fought back, and the law enforcement was much tougher, much sharper, much better. They really had no trouble handling them. It was like handling a baby for them. It was just like a baby. [Laughter] A lot of spoiled people in that group, you know. A lot of spoiled -- a lot of spoiled rich people saying, ""What are you doing here?"""
I've also made clear that any rioters damaging federal property and defacing our monuments will face severe and lengthy criminal penalties. [Applause] Ten years.
"Many of the young people here today have had your own encounters with left-wing extremists, such as Antifa. Joining us today are two students from North Carolina State University --- great place, great state -- Chris Thomas and Jack Bishop. Please come on up, fellas. Come on up. [Applause]"
How are you guys? Phoenix? [Applause] [Applause] Awesome.
"Listen, thank you so much, Mr. President. It's great to be out here in Phoenix. This is the first time I've ever been here, and I've got to say, it's been the experience of a lifetime."
"And, listen, I'm going to keep this short and sweet. I just want to say that conservative censorship on campus is real and it's happening all across the country, all the time."
"This past year, at NC State, we were having a event -- our Turning Point chapter was -- for Charlie Kirk and Lara Trump, at her alma mater, NC State. And we were posting ads -- advertisements in our free expression tunnel where you're allowed to paint whatever you want. We were making some advertisements, and we had about 20 socialist thugs roll up, from Antifa and from young Democratic Socialists of America. [Audience boos]"
"Now, for our trouble of course, they rolled up and attacked us, and they started spraying all over the work that we had just done. And for my trouble of -- I stood the line and tried my best to keep them from defacing our ads. And for my trouble, I was spray-painted in the eye. Yeah. Yeah. And unsurprisingly, of course, the school did nothing. There's a surprise. [Audience boos]"
"Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And they let Antifa run roughshod over our event. They let them in the room with us. They were protesting and screaming so loud that you could barely hear the speakers the entire time. And, of course, NC State, like many administrations across the country, does the will of the radical left. Mm-hmm. [Audience boos]"
"Meanwhile, conservatives across the country are punished and blacklisted merely for expressing our own opinions. We're ostracized and ousted with no support whatsoever from the administration."
"But let me tell you, when administrations across the country do the will of the left and cater to the mob, it's our duty as conservatives to stand up and to fight for our rights and to fight for our nation and to fight for our guy. [Applause]"
"And you know, Mr. President -- Mr. President, my dad, Congressman Dan Bishop, he likes to say that you like to say that he's not a choker. Mm-hmm."
[Inaudible] Choke.
"Mm-hmm. And let me tell you, Mr. President, us college conservatives, we ain't chokers neither. [Applause]"
"We're going to win this election. We're going to take back the House. We're going to keep the Senate. And we're going to get four more years of the best presidency of my lifetime, the presidency of Donald J. Trump. [Applause]"
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America! [Applause]
"Mr. President, thank you so much. It is an honor to be here with you today. Thank you for giving attention to our situation when the mainstream media back there wouldn't touch the story. [Audience boos]"
"Conservatives across this country are treated different every day by their professors and other students on campus. I was mocked by a leftist on my campus, not for my conservative beliefs, but for a medical condition I have that impacts my hair growth and my ability to sweat."
"I learned that when these leftist ideas fail, they resort to personal attacks because they have no facts to back up their radical beliefs."
Imagine how much of a fit the mainstream media would've thrown if 15 to 20 kids in MAGA hats had come up and spray-painted the kid in the eye and made fun of someone else for a medical condition they have.
"Our school, North Carolina State, did not do anything about this and they didn't discipline, and it was no coincidence that the Antifa logo showed up on the Free Expression Tunnel the next day. [Audience boos]"
"We are blessed to have a President like you that is devoted to protecting free speech on college campuses. And thank you, President Trump and Students for Trump. [Applause] Let's keep America great! Thank you. [Applause]"
"Great job, fellas. Thank you. So, you know, I signed an executive order, as you know. And based on what I'm just hearing, you should maybe be talking to Charlie or somebody around here about defunding that school because that's -- that's -- [applause] -- can't do that. That's exactly what the executive order was based on. So you talk to the people, maybe have your father call. His father is a great congressman. Done a great job. So, say hello to him."
"But you talk to them. That's exactly what it was for. We did something that was radical, but it wasn't radical to me. You have to be heard, and if you can't be heard, let's talk about it. Okay? [Applause]"
"As the radical left inflict violence on American streets, they're also waging war on timeless American values like freedom of speech, which is what we're just talking about. Anyone who dares to speak the truth is canceled, censored, de-platformed, fired, expelled, harassed, abused, boycotted, deprived of a livelihood, or even physically assaulted."
"Those times will be changing very soon. You can judge a movement by its behavior. And the young patriots here today don't destroy property. You don't burn buildings. You don't punish dissenters. And you don't try to erase the people with whom you disagree. It's called ""civilized"" people. You're civilized people. [Applause]"
"And yet, remember I said this: You're civilized, but you're much tougher than the other side. You're much tougher. Much tougher. [Applause]"
"You conduct yourselves with honor, integrity, and dignity because you know the truth, the facts, and the history -- all on your side."
"We're joined today by Reagan Escudé, a student at Northwestern State University of Louisiana. Reagan became a target of liberal cancel culture when she dared to stand up for her Christian values instead of bowing to political correctness."
"Reagan, please come up and say a few words, please. [Applause]"
"Well, thank you, Mr. President, for being here today with all of us and for inviting me up here to tell of my experience with cancel culture."
"My name is Reagan Escudé. I graduated from Northwestern State University of Louisiana in 2019, and I started my first job at a small, private insurance company in Louisiana."
"A few weeks ago, amidst all this chaos that we're seeing with the Black Lives Matter movement, I made a video on my Instagram and I talked about how disappointed I am in the church's reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement."
I've seen pastors call for white congregants to kneel and to apologize -- [Audience boos]
"-- and to apologize for the skin that God gave them. And I -- and I addressed these evangelical pastors and leaders and reminded them that racism is a problem in the heart. It is a sin problem that cannot be resolved by any law, protest, or march. [Applau"
"And so, of course, my leftist followers didn't appreciate this message at all. I had my name blasted all over social media. And people told me, ""You know, I'm ashamed to have ever called you my friend. I've lost all respect for you."" [Audience member calls out ""We love you""]"
"I love you all. And so, an ex-coworker of mine made a post on Facebook about me, calling me racist and homophobic. And she listed my place of employment and called for people to call my employer and have me fired. There were death threats made to the owners. There were threats to knock down the building. Law enforcement had to get involved. And due to the crazy reaction from the leftist mob, my employer told me that they came to the conclusion that they needed to terminate my employment. [Audience boos]"
But here's the thing. Here's the thing: Losing my job is a small price to pay when God's name is being glorified. [Applause] And He will always make His name known.
But I share -- I share this story with you -- I share this story with you because what happened to me is just a small example of something that's happening on a much larger scale in our nation.
"Aunt Jemima was canceled. And if you didn't know, Nancy Green, the original first Aunt Jemima, she was a picture of the American Dream. She was a freed slave who went on to be the face of the pancake syrup that we love and have in our pantries today. She fought for equality. And now the leftist mob is trying to erase her legacy."
And might I mentioned how privileged we are as a nation if our biggest concern is a bottle of pancake syrup. [Applause]
"And more recently, we're seeing a call for statues of Jesus Christ to be torn down. [Audience boos]"
"And now, I'm a little confused here because, last week, Jesus was a social justice warrior and this week he's the -- he's the face of white supremacy? And Jimmy Kimmel has been calling our President racist for years, and it turns out he's the racist. [Applause]"
There's -- there's governors that are getting away with wearing blackface; that's just sliding under the radar.
"So I want to encourage you all to stand firm in your beliefs. We need truth. We need hard, cold facts and truth now more than we ever have before, and we are so blessed to have a President who stands on the frontlines, walks through the fire every day to fight for our God-given American freedoms. [Applause, Audience chants ""USA""]"
"Do not apologize to the mob. And thank you, President Trump, for never apologizing to the mob, for always standing firm, for being here for the American people, and for fighting for our best interests, because you are the change that we need to see in America. Thank you. [Applause]"
"Thank you, Reagan. That was beautiful. You know, your story reminds us, Reagan, true courage is defying the left's orthodoxy, not submitting to it. We don't submit. Nobody should be submitting because we're winning and we're going to win. But you don't submit."
"The fake-news progressive companies, right there -- they're right back there watching us -- and other institutions merely towing the left-wing line have sacrificed their intellectual credibility and professional integrity. They have very little integrity left. Some of them have none. You're the ones taking real risks. You're showing real guts and making a virtuous stand."
"With the rise of social media, massive multinational tech companies have tried to clamp down on American democracy. That even means on me. And as everyone knows, they're using their enormous power to silence conservative voices. You know that. It's not even close. I don't even think they're hiding it anymore."
"To protect our democracy, I signed an executive order to remove legal protections for social media companies that unjustly censor American citizens. [Applause]"
"The radical left is also working to eliminate free speech on our college campuses. With us today is Nia Moore, a student at the University of St. Thomas in Minnesota -- [applause] -- who has experienced this persecution firsthand. Nia, please come up. Please. [Applause]"
"First, I just want to say thank you to Mr. President for having me onstage today. [Applause]"
"So, if you didn't know much about Minnesota about a month ago, I'm sure you've seen us in the headlines over the past few weeks. The DFL is successfully moving our state farther to the left more and more each day. Now, that isn't because people aren't conservative in Minnesota; it's because they're hell-bent on demonizing us at every turn."
"I began my career working in politics with Turning Point USA. [Applause] Unfortunately, due to the leftist culture of my campus at North Hennepin, we were shut down almost immediately and were refused official recognition. [Audience Boos]"
"I was told by the faculty that political groups were not welcome on campus. However, they had multiple leftist groups that supported Black -- the Black Lives Matter movement, they were pro-abortion -- [Audience Boos] -- and they've advocated for Bernie Sanders. [Audience Boos] I know."
"Our governor, the mayor -- I mean, sorry. Our governor, the mayor of Minneapolis, and the representative of the 5th congressional district in Minnesota are all Democrats. But for whatever reason, the Republicans and the President take the blame for what has taken place.  [Audience Boos]"
"Unfortunately, the murder of George Floyd has created absolute chaos in my state of Minnesota. They have -- sorry, I lost my place. [Applause]"
"Ever since the murder of George Floyd, I have not seen as much division, deceit, and destruction in my life. Black Lives Matter only makes a scene during election years. How convenient that they made the biggest scene of all during the year of the most important election of our time. [Applause] Thank you."
"Black Lives Matter is only about police brutality once every four years. In between, they're heavily funding a push for leftist and LGBTQ-plus agendas.  [Audience Boos]"
"The black community's culture is naturally very conservative, so they mask their hidden agendas and play on the community's biggest fear. [Applause]"
"If Black Lives Matter truly cared about black lives, they would not have allowed the riots to destroy black businesses and black communities. [Applause]"
"If they cared about black lives, they would defund Planned Parenthood. [Applause]"
"If Black Lives Matter cared about black lives, they would address the astronomically high numbers of black-on-black crime in inner cities. [Applause]"
"They try to paint us as the bad guys for not supporting the organization, but it's not the saying ""Black Lives Matter."" I think there's very few conservatives that believe black lives don't matter. [Applause] We do believe black lives matter. We just believe they all matter, not just the lives the left chooses to exploit. [Applause]"
"I am the field director for Ilhan Omar's challenger, Lacy Johnson. [Applause] He is the first Republican in Minnesota to have Black Lives Matter activists and lifelong Democrats want to hear what he has to say. [Applause] Because of that, they've tried to silence us at every turn. People are fed up, and they're getting nervous."
"They will stop at nothing to keep our -- their hold on us, even if that means lying to the very people they're supposed to represent."
"Mr. President, I just want to say thank you for being an example -- a great example of a big-tent Republican. The President has never needed the black vote to win, but he has still incredible work with prison reform, lowering black unemployment, funding HBCUs, and stimulating the black community with Opportunity Zones. [Applause] All without pandering."
"Once upon a time, the President asked the black community what we had to lose. We didn't have anything, but now we do. [Applause]"
"Thank you, Mr. President. [Applause]"
"Thank you. Thank you, Nia. Well, Nia, I want to just to tell you -- first of all, thank you very much. And so heartfelt, I could see that."
"And I also issued a historical executive order defending free speech, and all of this is on college campuses. And I will tell you that it's something that's being used by people like Charlie and used very well, and it's opening up a whole new voice. And it's my honor to have done it. Under my order, any college that refuses to let you speak stands to lose billions of dollars in terms of the overall system. [Applause]"
"So we've done a lot, and we've really gone very far. We've taken it to a level that nobody has ever taken it. And it's my honor to have done it. It's people like you that I do it for. When you think about it, it's people like you. You're going to be the ones -- [applause] -- you're going to be the ones that are at the crossroads of history. That's where you are right now. You're at a crossroads."
"Everything our forefathers built, everything generations past -- they shed their blood to defend the very survival of our freedoms, our rights, and our republic. They're all at stake. This is a very big time in our country. This is a time like perhaps no other."
"But standing here before you today, I have never been more confident that America will rise to new heights of greatness and glory, because your generation is proving that your hearts are filled with the fire and the fervor of true American patriots. [Applause]"
"The great spirit of righteous defiance stirs deep within you. I see that. It's the same spirit that drove American's founders and frontiersmen -- people that built our nation, people that succeeded, people that worked hard, people that failed -- people that failed. Some people failed, and then they made it bigger than anyone would have believed possible. To defend all of your liberties, to secure your independence, and establish this noble fortress of freedom. It's the same spirit that compels each of you to stand strong against the dull, mindless, soul-crushing conformity mandated by far-left pundits, professors, and liberal politicians. They're taking our country in the wrong direction. [Applause]"
"And it's the same fierce and untamed American spirit that will lead the young, patriotic Americans of this generation to serve our country. And you will serve it well. You will serve it so well."
"Together, we will restore our economy quickly. We will rebuild our nation. We will revitalize our cities. We will take back our universities and colleges. [Applause] And we will preserve the America we love for you and for your children. We will defend our values, our voices, our faith, our heritage, our borders, our rights, and our God-given freedoms. [Applause]"
"Calling on the boldness and bravery of your generation, we will unite citizens of every race and color, religion and creed as one people, one family, and one extraordinary nation under God. [Applause]"
"And with your help, this moment will be a turning point -- [Applause] -- in American history that will be remembered and celebrated for generations to come. For our young people, for our economy, for our communities, and for our beloved country, the best is yet to come. [Applause]"
Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. Thank you. [Applause]
